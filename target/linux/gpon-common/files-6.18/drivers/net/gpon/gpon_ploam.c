/*
 * gpon_ploam.c — G.984.3 PLOAM activation state machine (O1..O7):
 *                the HARDWARE-DECOUPLED protocol core.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 *   The decision half of the ONU activation engine: downstream PLOAM dispatch,
 *   the O1->O5 transitions, the upstream message builders (Serial_Number,
 *   Password, Acknowledge, Encryption_Key, No_message), the burst-overhead and
 *   equalization-delay computations, and the periodic-poll decisions (SN
 *   re-offer cadence, O5 keepalive cadence, downstream-LOS re-range debounce,
 *   O5 provisioning watchdog). See gpon_ploam.h for the full contract.
 *
 * WHY IT IS COMMON  (operator, 2026-08-05: "en openwrt debería estar
 *   estructurado algo así: rtl960x* para la familia para tener código común"
 *   … "la idea es poner en común el código que corresponde para no tener mucho
 *   duplicado")
 *   Compiled from the shared tree into BOTH OpenWrt targets — realtek-luna
 *   (MIPS32 big-endian) and realtek-elnath (ARM64 little-endian) — and onto
 *   x86-64 for the offline differential/fuzz suite. Every wire field is read
 *   with explicit byte math, so the same source produces the same decisions on
 *   all three. Measured honestly: only realtek-luna consumes it TODAY (Elnath's
 *   MAC runs PLOAM in silicon); it earns its place through offline adversarial
 *   testing and the roadmap, not through de-duplication — the header says so at
 *   length rather than claiming a saving that does not exist.
 *
 * THE CORE / SHELL RULE THIS FILE OBEYS
 *   This file DECIDES; the shell DOES. ★ IT MUST NEVER GAIN AN MMIO ACCESS —
 *   no readl/writel/ioremap, no jiffies or timers, no sleeping or delays, no
 *   locks, no allocation, no printk, no device pointers. Time enters as an
 *   explicit `now_ms` argument and as the shell-advanced tick counter. The one
 *   hardware value a decision genuinely needs mid-flight (US_MIN_DELAY) arrives
 *   through an op. The offline gate greps this file for those tokens and
 *   requires zero.
 *
 * PROVENANCE AND FIDELITY
 *   Pure code motion out of
 *   realtek-luna/files-6.18/drivers/net/ethernet/realtek/gpon-rtl9602c.c,
 *   which is at stock parity. Every block names the source lines it came from.
 *   Nothing was "improved" on the way: where a defect was found it was moved
 *   unchanged and recorded below, because a fix folded into a move makes the
 *   next regression un-bisectable.
 *
 * FOLLOW-UPS — found while moving, DELIBERATELY NOT FIXED HERE
 *   P1  gpon_tcont_installed is never set true anywhere in the driver
 *       (declared :967, cleared :6339/:6569/:6658/:6695, read only by two log
 *       sites :6282/:6422). Both readers therefore report a constant false.
 *   P2  RESOLVED here — see "THE THREE SESSION-STATE FIXES" below.
 *   P3  RESOLVED here — see "THE THREE SESSION-STATE FIXES" below.
 *   P4  In the burst-overhead build, `boh_len` is u8 and is assigned
 *       `rep + t3 + 3`, which is computed as int and can reach 262 before the
 *       truncation — so the `> GPON_PLOAM_BOH_MAX_LEN` clamp on the next line
 *       cannot see a value that already wrapped. Needs t3 >= 249 from the OLT's
 *       Extended_Burst_Length; no real OLT sends that. Moved verbatim.
 *   P5  The Assign_ONU-ID comment block (:6242-6259) describes omcc_alloc being
 *       captured from Assign_Alloc-ID "for subsequent re-ranges". It is not:
 *       the 2026-07-03 root-cause fix stopped writing it (:6440) and grep finds
 *       no writer, so it is the module_param override only. Comment is stale;
 *       the code it describes is correct and is moved as-is.
 *   P6  Password/Acknowledge/Encryption_Key all build m[0] = our ONU-ID, while
 *       the Request_Password, Key_Switching_Time and BER_interval cases accept
 *       a broadcast 0xff — where our ONU-ID may still be 0xff. Harmless on the
 *       wire because the hardware rewrites the field (ONUID_OVRD), but the
 *       BUILT buffer and the TRANSMITTED frame disagree, so a buffer-level
 *       differential against the oracle mismatches unless the oracle models the
 *       override. Decide which side is authoritative before writing that test.
 *   P7  Elnath resolves four of these cases differently and G.988/G.984.3 side
 *       with Elnath: Disable_SN should move the ONU to O7 (here: O1, so we
 *       re-announce the serial number the OLT just disabled), an O5->O7 drop is
 *       not detected, and O6 POPUP tears down where Elnath keeps the session
 *       alive. Not changed: this target is off the rig and each is a wire
 *       behaviour change needing its own board gate.
 *
 * THE THREE SESSION-STATE FIXES (the old FOLLOW-UPs P2 and P3), each pinned by
 * an adversarial-OLT case in dev/rtl9607c-test/gpon_data_bind_test.c (step 19)
 * that was SEEN to fail on the pre-fix source, and by
 * gpon_data_bind_policy_test.c (step 19b) over the shipping Luna driver.
 *
 *   1. THE DATA T-CONT LATCH SURVIVED EVERY TEARDOWN.  data_tcont_installed had
 *      no teardown clear at all; its ONLY clear site is the OLT's explicit
 *      Deallocate, which additionally requires `alloc == data_alloc`, i.e. the
 *      Alloc-ID of the session that has just ended.  So a re-config that hands
 *      out a DIFFERENT Alloc-ID was refused by the install guard, and the one
 *      path that could have recovered was waiting for an Alloc-ID the OLT will
 *      never send again: the WAN data T-CONT stayed dark until a reboot.  All
 *      four teardowns now clear it, together with data_alloc, exactly as they
 *      already cleared its three siblings.
 *
 *   2. data_gem_solicited NOW FOLLOWS THE IDENTITY, NOT THE PATH.  The four
 *      teardowns diverged three ways and only two said why.  The rule that
 *      explains all four is that the flag means "the OLT currently holds a
 *      GEM-CTP for THIS ONU identity": an OLT Deactivate/Disable_SN
 *      deprovisions us (CLEAR, it re-sends ME 268 on re-admit); the two
 *      ONU-INITIATED re-ranges leave the OLT's provisioning untouched (KEEP —
 *      clearing them is the proven "internet doesn't come back after I
 *      reconnect the fiber"); and the serial-number reprovision makes us a
 *      DIFFERENT ONU, so what the OLT holds is not ours (CLEAR — keeping it
 *      installed the data GEM the moment the new identity reached O5,
 *      proactively ahead of the new session's own ME 268, which is precisely
 *      the second-admit churn-lock this gate exists to prevent).
 *
 *   3. THE DATA GEM PORT-ID IS THE OLT'S.  It arrived in ME 268 attribute 1 and
 *      was discarded, and the install wrote a per-board constant.  It is now
 *      carried through data_gem_port into the install op, the way the OMCC's
 *      GEM Port-ID has always come from Configure_Port-ID.

 * O1 and re-acquire when light returns. Without this the FSM sits stale at O5
 * after a fibre pull and never re-ranges on reconnect.
 *
 * Real light loss = the GTC optical LOS AND the SoC SerDes signal-detect both
 * gone. An I2C pad steal perturbs the optical LOS alone (signal-detect stays
 * up); an internal SerDes re-seat can blip signal-detect alone (optical LOS
 * stays clear); only a true fibre pull drops BOTH. Requiring the AND lets the
 * debounce be short without false-tripping on either transient. Once at O1 the
 * state gate stops counting until the FSM climbs back past O1 on relight.
 *
