 * TIER: CORE (prefix gpon_) — protocol only.  NEVER touches hardware:
 * no register access, no clock, no lock, no allocator, no device pointer.
 * One source compiles for MIPS big-endian, ARM64 little-endian and x86.
 * Role: Upstream GEM and T-CONT mapping — interface.
 *
 * Canonical tier rule, the file map and the guard name live in ONE place:
 * see "THE THREE TIERS" in gpon_common.h (this directory).
 * Guard: dev/rtl9607c-test/gpon_layer_hostbuild_test.sh (suite step 17) —
 * it COMPILES this tier against stubs that declare no register accessor,
 * no clock, no lock and no allocator, so impurity cannot build.
 *
 * gpon_gem_us.h — the UPSTREAM half of GEM provisioning: the two mappings a
 * G.984 ONU must get right before it may transmit, common to every OpenWrt
 * GPON target in this tree.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 *   Two mappings, and nothing else:
 *     1. Alloc-ID -> T-CONT.  Whether an OLT-assigned Alloc-ID may be bound to
 *        the ONU's data T-CONT, or must be left alone because it is already
 *        the OMCC's.  Both targets implemented this predicate independently and
 *        both produced a real outage from it (see gpon_gem_us_tcont_decide()).
 *     2. GEM Port-ID -> the upstream index slots that stamp it.  Which entries
 *        of the per-chip upstream port-map array carry a given GEM Port-ID, as
 *        a DECLARED range the shell supplies — never a computed one.
 *
 *   It is a decision layer, not a lifecycle layer.  It holds no state: the
 *   provisioning shadow (has the OLT sent ME 262 and ME 268 yet, what is armed
 *   in silicon, what survives a LOS) belongs to the GEM provisioning lifecycle
 *   and to each target's shell.  Everything here is a pure function of its
 *   arguments, so the same call with the same inputs is the same answer on any
 *   target, at any time, in any context.
 *
 * ★ WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* HERE — GEM header build, fragmentation, HEC
 *   The refactor brief asked this file to also carry "header build,
 *   fragmentation".  It does not, because on both shipping targets there is no
 *   such software to carry: the GEM Transmission Convergence layer is silicon.
 *   Measured 2026-08-05, and stated here so nobody spends a day looking for it:
 *     - realtek-elnath: the MAC encapsulates.  cortina-gpon.c:2390 — the 48-byte
 *       OMCI PDU "goes out the NI DMA-LSO ring; the HW GEM-encapsulates it onto
 *       the OMCC upstream on the next matching BWmap grant".  Upstream
 *       fragmentation is a PUC scheduler register field, not code:
 *       cortina-gpon.c:1362-1369 programs BTCCFG schmode=FRAGMENT(0) and
 *       lrgfrmfragen=1.  A search of that file for PLI / GEM header / fragment /
 *       reassembly framing returns only hardware counters
 *       (CG_REG_GEM_FRAG_DROP 0x1ac, CG_REG_DS_ASMBL_DROP 0x1cc) — i.e. reports
 *       from the MAC's own framer and reassembler.
 *     - realtek-luna: the GTC encapsulates.  The driver writes the port-map
 *       stamp (gpon-rtl9602c.c:5486, :5644) and the reassembly timer / PTI mask
 *       (:5449, :5478) and the engine does the rest.  It builds no GEM header.
 *   ⇒ There is nothing to hoist.  The INDEPENDENT model of what that silicon
 *   does lives in dev/rtl9607c-oracle/ (gem_tc.c, gem_us_encap.c) and MUST stay
 *   there: it is the differential reference this layer is tested against, and a
 *   reference merged into the thing it checks can no longer fail.
 *   A future target whose MAC does less — the ARM OLT on the roadmap, another
 *   brand — would need a real software framer.  It belongs beside this file as
 *   its own gpon_gem_tc.c when a target actually needs it, written against the
 *   oracle, and NOT invented speculatively here.
 *
 * WHY IT IS COMMON — which targets and which architectures compile it
 *   Operator, 2026-08-05: "en openwrt debería estar estructurado algo así:
 *   rtl960x* para la familia para tener código común" … "la idea es poner en
 *   común el código que corresponde para no tener mucho duplicado", and on the
 *   two per-target monoliths each carrying their own copy: "mal, poner en
 *   común".
 *   Compiled by:
 *     - realtek-elnath (RTL9607F, Cortina)  aarch64, LITTLE-endian
 *     - realtek-luna   (RTL960xC, Luna)     MIPS32,  BIG-endian
 *     - dev/rtl9607c-test on x86-64 through fuzz_shims/, where it is driven
 *       offline against the oracle with no board in the loop
 *   The prefix is gpon_ and not luna_ on purpose: the layer must also serve
 *   the future ARM OLT and other brands, so a Realtek-named prefix would be too
 *   narrow for what it covers.
 *
 * THE CORE/SHELL RULE IT OBEYS
 *   FUNCTIONAL CORE.  It decides; it never does.  No MMIO, no readl/writel, no
 *   ioremap, no device pointer, no allocation, no lock, no sleeping, no clock
 *   read.  The shell owns every register transaction, every completion poll and
 *   the order they run in — the upstream teardown order in particular is a
 *   hardware fact that differs per family and must never migrate here.
 *   ★ THIS FILE MUST NEVER GAIN AN MMIO ACCESS.  The moment it does, it stops
 *   being drivable from the x86 suite, the offline adversarial gate loses this
 *   area, and the only remaining way to check an upstream mapping is a ~200 s
 *   board boot.  A guard scans every gpon_*.c/h for exactly that.
 *
 *   Endianness: this file parses no wire bytes — the Alloc-ID and the GEM
 *   Port-ID arrive already extracted by the PLOAM/OMCI layers.  So the
 *   explicit-byte-math rule binds it vacuously, and it is NOT evidence that the
 *   rule is being honoured.  What the executed big-endian run does prove is
 *   that the index arithmetic and the field masks below give identical answers
 *   on MIPS-BE and on x86 — which is the only endianness claim this file makes.

 * ★ THREE DIFFERENT 12-BIT-ISH THINGS ARE ALL CALLED "gem" IN THIS TREE, AND
 * CONFUSING TWO OF THEM HAS ALREADY COST A BOARD-PROVEN REGRESSION.  They are
 * named apart here, once, so a later reader cannot unify them by accident:
 *
 *   GEM Port-ID   the number ON THE WIRE (G.984.3, 12 bits).  The OLT assigns
 *                 it; the OMCC's arrives in Configure_Port-ID, the data one in
 *                 OMCI ME 268.  This is the only one of the three that is a
 *                 protocol value, and the only one this file names "port_id".
 *   US index      the per-chip slot number in the upstream port-map array that
 *                 STAMPS a Port-ID onto a burst.  A silicon index, unrelated to
 *                 the wire value.  Called "index"/"range" here, never "gem".
 *   mcgid         (Cortina only) an egress LDPID port-group.  Not a GEM number
 *                 at all.  cortina-ni-flowoffload.c:2156-2163 records what
 *                 happened when it was set to a GEM Port-ID: "the old
 *                 mcgid = gem_id(223) was an aal-gen2/gemMapMode misread and
 *                 steered the hit frame to the WRONG egress -> far-end received
 *                 nothing."  It stays entirely inside the NE and appears
 *                 nowhere in this file.

/* G.984.3 field widths.  Both are SPEC facts (Alloc-ID and GEM Port-ID are each

 * (alloc) and :2216/:2071 (port-id); Luna gpon-rtl9602c.c:5770 (alloc) and
 * :5645/:5486 (port-id).
 * The T-CONT index width is NOT here: 5 bits is a CAM-index width that both
 * silicons happen to share, not something G.984.3 defines, so it stays a
 * per-chip fact in each shell (Luna GPON_GTC_DS_ALLOC_IND, Elnath

 *                     OMCC  = { .base = 0, .count = 8 }   (:304, :2067)
 *                     data  = { .base = 8, .count = 8 }   (:2210-2220)
 *   Luna (RTL960xC)   the slot is a fixed GTC flow/SID per role, with no

 * @index_max is the last slot the chip's array actually has (Luna 127, Elnath
 * 255).  It is carried so the range can be checked against the ARRAY's extent
 * rather than against a maximum somebody remembered: a count, a maximum, a
 * stride and an index space are four different quantities, and an upstream
 * write past the end of the port-map array lands in an unrelated register and
 * is accepted without complaint.
