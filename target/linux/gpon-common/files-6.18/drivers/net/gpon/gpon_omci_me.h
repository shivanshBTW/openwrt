 * TIER: CORE (prefix gpon_) — protocol only.  NEVER touches hardware:
 * no register access, no clock, no lock, no allocator, no device pointer.
 * One source compiles for MIPS big-endian, ARM64 little-endian and x86.
 * Role: G.988 managed-entity model — interface.
 *
 * Canonical tier rule, the file map and the guard name live in ONE place:
 * see "THE THREE TIERS" in gpon_common.h (this directory).
 * Guard: dev/rtl9607c-test/gpon_layer_hostbuild_test.sh (suite step 17) —
 * it COMPILES this tier against stubs that declare no register accessor,
 * no clock, no lock and no allocator, so impurity cannot build.
 *
 * gpon_omci_me.h — the ITU-T G.988 MANAGED-ENTITY model and MIB store, common
 * to every OpenWrt GPON target in this tree.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 *   The ONU's answer to "which managed entities do I hold, and what are their
 *   attribute bytes".  Three things, and nothing else:
 *     1. the TABLE-DRIVEN attribute descriptors — one row per (class,
 *        attribute) carrying {attribute number, wire size, value source} — plus
 *        the ONE generic filler that walks them;
 *     2. the STATIC MIB-Upload row table, i.e. the ONU's statement of which
 *        instances exist and how their attributes split across the 26-octet
 *        Upload-Next value area;
 *     3. the DYNAMIC store of the instances the OLT itself created, and the
 *        context struct (struct omci_onu) that holds all of it.
 *   It does NOT parse a PDU, dispatch a message type, build a response
 *   envelope, stamp a trailer or compute a MIC.  That is the MESSAGE layer,
 *   gpon_omci_core.{h,c}, which CALLS this one.  The seam is deliberate: the
 *   G.988 message rules are identical on every ONU ever built, while the set of
 *   MEs a product serves is a property of the PRODUCT.
 *
 *   Table-driven, and that is a footprint decision as much as a design one:
 *   one descriptor row per attribute costs bytes where a hand-written
 *   serialiser per ME costs kilobytes, and these ONUs ship with <=64 MB RAM and
 *   a small NAND.  It is also what makes three cross-vendor invariants
 *   STRUCTURAL instead of per-case — every reply bounded by the Get value area,
 *   the set of attributes an ME knows being derivable (so a Get can NAME the
 *   ones it does not support and the ones that did not fit, instead of
 *   answering success with a short mask and generating the OLT re-GET churn),
 *   and one policy per vendor-reserved class range instead of a hard-coded list
 *   of the class IDs one OLT happened to ask for.
 *
 * WHY IT IS COMMON — and which targets and architectures compile it
 *   Operator, 2026-08-05: "en openwrt debería estar estructurado algo así:
 *   rtl960x* para la familia para tener código común" … "la idea es poner en
 *   común el código que corresponde para no tener mucho duplicado", and on the
 *   two per-target monoliths that each carry a private copy: "mal, poner en
 *   común".
 *   Compiled by:
 *     - realtek-elnath (RTL9607F, Cortina)   aarch64, LITTLE-endian  — today
 *     - realtek-luna   (RTL960xC, Luna)      MIPS32,  BIG-endian     — NOT yet.
 *       Luna carries a third, independently written ME model in
 *       rtl9602c_eth.c, on static file-scope globals rather than a context
 *       struct, with a different identity (HSGQ-X111W) and a different ME 7 /
 *       ME 11 attribute set.  Pointing Luna at this file CHANGES LUNA'S
 *       EMITTED BYTES, so it is a behaviour change with its own board gate —
 *       follow-ups F1/F2/F3 — and was deliberately NOT part of the code-motion
 *       refactor that created this file.  Nothing here was altered to
 *       accommodate it.
 *     - dev/rtl9607c-test on x86-64 through fuzz_shims/, where the whole model
 *       is swept exhaustively (every attribute mask x every modelled class)
 *       under ASan+UBSan
 *   The prefix is gpon_ and not luna_ on purpose: the layer must also serve
 *   the future ARM OLT and other brands, so a Realtek-named prefix would be too
 *   narrow for what it covers.
 *
 * THE CORE/SHELL RULE IT OBEYS
 *   FUNCTIONAL CORE.  It decides; it never does.  It answers questions about
 *   the MIB and fills caller-provided buffers.  No device pointer, no lock (the
 *   caller serialises), no allocation, no sleeping, no clock read — every byte
 *   of state lives in the caller-provided struct omci_onu.  The imperative
 *   shell (cortina-gpon.c on Elnath) owns the OMCC binding, the TX ring, the
 *   i2c DDM read and the /proc view; it publishes a live optical measurement
 *   through omci_onu_set_optical() and never reaches into the model otherwise.
 *
 *   => THIS FILE AND ITS .c MUST NEVER GAIN AN MMIO ACCESS.  No readl/writel,
 *   no ioremap, no msleep/udelay, no jiffies, no spin_lock/mutex, no kmalloc,
 *   no dev_ or netdev_ logging, no schedule_work.  The purity check greps for
 *   exactly that set and the gate goes red if one appears.  It is not hygiene:
 *   that property is what makes the model host-compilable, host-fuzzable and
 *   portable across the two architectures at once.
 *   (Written "dev_ or netdev_" and not with a glob on purpose: the obvious
 *   spelling puts the two characters that CLOSE a block comment in the middle
 *   of one, and the compiler then reads the rest of the banner as code.)
 *
 * ENDIANNESS
 *   Every attribute value is emitted big-endian by explicit byte math (see
 *   omci_attr_bytes() in the .c: an integer is shifted into a 4-byte scratch
 *   MSB-first and taken right-aligned).  Never a struct or pointer cast over
 *   wire bytes, never htons/ntohs on a buffer.  That is not style: it is the
 *   reason ONE source compiles for big-endian MIPS and little-endian ARM64 and
 *   emits the same octets on both.
 *
 * PROVENANCE
 *   Code motion, 2026-08-05, from realtek-elnath's omci_responder.{c,h} — the
 *   already-pure ME model of the driver that is at stock parity.  The logic is
 *   byte-for-byte what shipped; the only textual changes are the file split
 *   itself and dropping `static` from the nine functions the message layer
 *   calls across the new file boundary.  A defect found while moving is written
 *   down, never fixed in the same step, or the regression stops bisecting.
