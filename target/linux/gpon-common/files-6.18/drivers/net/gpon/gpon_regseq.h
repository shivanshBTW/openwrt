 * TIER: CORE (drivers/net/gpon) -- HW-DECOUPLED.  Builds on MIPS-BE, ARM64-LE
 * and x86.  No MMIO, no clock, no allocator: see "THE THREE TIERS" in
 * gpon_common.h.
 *
 * gpon_regseq -- a bring-up expressed as DATA, and the tiny interpreter that
 * runs it.
 *
 * ★ WHY THIS IS CORE AND NOT FAMILY.  The register ADDRESSES and VALUES of a
 * bring-up are silicon facts and stay with the silicon.  What runs them is not:
 * "write this word, then set these bits, then wait, then poll that bit until it
 * clears or give up" is the same algorithm on every PON MAC anyone has ever
 * shipped, and it was written once per family for no reason but that the
 * interpreter and the tables lived in one file.
 *
 * ★★ TIME IS AN EXPLICIT INPUT, and that is what made this movable at all.  The
 * family version called `mdelay()` and `udelay()` directly, which the core
 * forbids -- not as bureaucracy, but because a driver that sleeps cannot be run
 * on a host.  With the two delays as ops, the same interpreter that drives the
 * silicon can be driven by a FIXTURE clock in an offline test at thousands of
 * sequences per second, which is this project's stated preference over one
 * ~200 s board boot.
 *
 * ⚠ THE POLL BUDGET IS IN ITERATIONS, NOT MILLISECONDS, and it is the caller's.
 * A core that decided the timeout would be deciding a hardware fact it cannot
 * know; a family that decides it is stating one it measured.
