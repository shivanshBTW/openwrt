/*
 * gpon_ploam.h — G.984.3 PLOAM activation state machine (O1..O7): the
 *                HARDWARE-DECOUPLED protocol core.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 *   The ONU-side PLOAM engine: downstream message dispatch, the O1->O5
 *   activation transitions, the upstream message BUILDERS (Serial_Number,
 *   Password, Acknowledge, Encryption_Key, No_message), the burst-overhead
 *   (BOH) computation and the equalization-delay (EqD) computation, plus the
 *   periodic-poll DECISIONS (SN re-offer cadence, O5 keepalive cadence, the
 *   downstream-LOS re-range debounce, the O5 provisioning watchdog).
 *
 *   Everything here is pure byte math over the 13-byte wire message and pure
 *   arithmetic over counters. Every SIDE EFFECT leaves through
 *   `struct gpon_ploam_ops`.
 *
 * WHY IT IS COMMON  (operator, 2026-08-05: "en openwrt debería estar
 *   estructurado algo así: rtl960x* para la familia para tener código común"
 *   … "la idea es poner en común el código que corresponde para no tener mucho
 *   duplicado")
 *
 *   Built from `target/linux/gpon-common/files-6.18/`, which BOTH OpenWrt
 *   targets pull in through `FILES_DIR +=`:
 *       realtek-luna    MIPS32 BIG-endian    (RTL9602C / 9603C / 9607C, Luna)
 *       realtek-elnath  ARM64 LITTLE-endian  (RTL9607F, Cortina NE)
 *   and it also compiles for x86-64 in `dev/rtl9607c-test/`, where it is driven
 *   by the ordered differential suite against the INDEPENDENT oracle in
 *   `dev/rtl9607c-oracle/`. One source, three endianness/word-size
 *   combinations: all wire-field extraction is explicit byte math
 *   (`((u32)d[1] << 24) | ...`), never a struct or pointer cast over wire
 *   bytes, never htons()/ntohs().
 *
 *   ★ HONEST SCOPE, MEASURED 2026-08-05, and it is not what the refactor brief
 *   assumed: this file has exactly ONE kernel consumer today. Elnath has NO
 *   software PLOAM FSM — its MAC runs O1->O5 and auto-ACKs in silicon
 *   (`cortina-gpon.c:1955`); a grep for a PLOAM dispatch there returns zero.
 *   So this file is NOT justified by de-duplication. It is justified by
 *     (a) offline adversarial testing — the FSM becomes fuzzable on x86 under
 *         libFuzzer+ASan+UBSan with an adversarial OLT, with no board in the
 *         loop, which is this project's PRIMARY correctness gate;
 *     (b) the roadmap — the future ARM OLT and other ONU brands need this same
 *         engine, and a chip whose MAC does NOT run PLOAM in silicon needs it
 *         verbatim.
 *   Saying so plainly is the point; claiming a saving that does not exist would
 *   be the same reassuring-direction reporting this project keeps paying for.
 *
 * THE CORE / SHELL RULE THIS FILE OBEYS
 *   CORE (here): DECIDES. Parses wire bytes, runs the FSM, builds reply
 *                buffers, computes BOH/EqD words, owns the activation state.
 *   SHELL (per target): DOES. Reads/writes registers, arms DMA, services IRQs,
 *                drives the PON MAC — and calls this core.
 *
 *   ★ THIS FILE MUST NEVER GAIN AN MMIO ACCESS. No readl/writel, no ioremap,
 *   no `struct device`, no jiffies, no timers, no msleep/udelay, no locks, no
 *   allocation, no printk. TIME IS AN EXPLICIT INPUT (`now_ms`) and the tick
 *   counter is advanced by the shell; a hardware read needed mid-decision is an
 *   op (`get_min_delay`), never a register touch. The offline gate G1 greps for
 *   exactly those tokens over every gpon_*.c/h and must score 0 — the guard is
 *   mutation-proven by adding one readl() and confirming the gate goes red.
 *
 *   This is also the specific way the previous attempt at this refactor failed:
 *   the dead `gpon_proto.c` reached "HW freedom" by DELETING the 8 MMIO calls,
 *   the udelay(500) and the schedule_work() from inside the handler, and it
 *   kept file-scope globals. Both mistakes are structurally impossible here:
 *   every removed effect is an op, and all state lives in `struct gpon_ploam`.
 *
 * PROVENANCE
 *   Code motion out of the Luna monolith
 *   `realtek-luna/files-6.18/drivers/net/ethernet/realtek/gpon-rtl9602c.c`,
 *   which is at stock parity. Each block below names the source line range it
 *   came from. Behaviour is intended to be BIT-IDENTICAL: where Elnath does
 *   something different, or where a latent defect was found while moving, the
 *   code is moved UNCHANGED and the divergence is recorded as a follow-up in
 *   the comment at that site (see gpon_ploam.c "FOLLOW-UPS").

 * cosmetic problem: compiling on x86 is the entire justification for this layer

 * ★ NOTE — this is deliberately NOT `struct gpon_shell_ops` from the plan's

 *   - `ploam_tx(sh, msg[12])` drops the US_PLOAM_IND QUEUE selector, and the

 *     (0x6), which is what gets an Acknowledge to the OLT before it raises LOAi,
 *     and the No_message rides the HW auto slot (0x7). Losing it is a wire
 *     change, so the queue is carried.
 *   - `set_eqd(sh, eqd)` implies the core packs the EqD REGISTER word. The
 *     multiframe/in-frame field layout is a register fact; the core hands over
 *     the two computed quantities and the shell packs them.
 * FOLLOW-UP: when the two op tables are unified, unify them in this direction —

 * ★ EVERY ONE TAKES `now_ms`: a free-running millisecond clock the shell
 * supplies. The core never reads a clock. `now_ms` is only ever used through
 * wrap-safe signed differences, so any 32-bit monotonic ms source works.
 *
 * ★ THE POLL ISLANDS ARE SEPARATE CALLS ON PURPOSE. In the Luna driver these
 * decisions are INTERLEAVED with shell-only work inside one poll function, and
 * the interleaving is load-bearing: the feed re-kick and the upstream-interrupt
 * service are gated on `state == O5 && omcc_installed`, which the watchdog and
 * the LOS re-range can clear in the same tick. Merging the islands into one
 * poll() would change which of them run on the tick a re-range fires. So the
 * shell calls them at exactly the points it called the original blocks:
