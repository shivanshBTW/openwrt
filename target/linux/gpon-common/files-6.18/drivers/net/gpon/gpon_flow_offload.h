 * TIER: CORE.  ⚠ NOT in the STRICT host-buildable subset -- it uses Linux's TC
 * offload API and an rhashtable on purpose.  See "THE THREE TIERS" in
 * gpon_common.h: the line is the REGISTER, not Linux.
 *
 * gpon_flow_offload -- the TC hardware-offload LIFECYCLE, once.
 *
 * ★★ WHY THIS EXISTS (operator, 2026-08-28): *"generaliza para todos los
 * hardware que no hacen offload y los que sí, así en la familia es solo un
 * #ifdef"*.  A family whose silicon has a flow accelerator supplies the ops
 * below; a family without one compiles none of this (CONFIG_GPON_FLOW_OFFLOAD
 * is not set, and on Luna that is not an object saved -- it is a fatal error
 * avoided, because <net/flow_offload.h> pulls in a TC stack that target does
 * not build).
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ★★★ THE SEAM IS NOT WHERE I FIRST DREW IT, AND THE CODE SAID SO.
 *
 * The first version of this header offered "3 questions + 3 engine calls":
 * is_lan_side / wan_vid / wan_vlan_programmable, then install/remove/stats.
 * That contract is WRONG, and only READING the one existing implementation
 * showed it -- no classifier could have.  `cn_flow_replace()` is ~850 lines,
 * and its generic and silicon halves are not stacked, they are INTERLEAVED:
 * a PPPoE leg gate whose input is a driver-held session SHADOW; a lazy
 * one-time DS arm that touches hardware; an egress L3-IF program; a VLAN
 * readback BY LITERAL BIT NUMBER out of the FIB table.  None of that is a
 * fact about TC, and a core that reached for `wan_vid()` would have been
 * reaching for the two or three of those it happened to be able to name.
 *
 * So the seam is drawn where it actually falls:
 *
 *   CORE  -- what nf_flow_table means, and what a cookie map costs:
 *            the dedup, the action DECODE, the NAT-shape refusal, the entry
 *            allocation, the insert with its undo, destroy, stats.
 *   FAMILY-- ONE call, `prepare`, holding every decision that needs to read
 *            or write silicon, and `install`/`remove`/`stats` under it.
 *
 * `prepare` is deliberately allowed to be large.  It is not a wart: a 400-line
 * prepare in the family is exactly the code that MUST NOT be shared, and
 * naming it once is what lets the 200 lines around it be shared at all.
