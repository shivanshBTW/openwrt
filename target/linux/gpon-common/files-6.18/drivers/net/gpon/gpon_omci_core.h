 * TIER: CORE (prefix gpon_) — protocol only.  NEVER touches hardware:
 * no register access, no clock, no lock, no allocator, no device pointer.
 * One source compiles for MIPS big-endian, ARM64 little-endian and x86.
 * Role: G.988 OMCI message layer — interface.
 *
 * Canonical tier rule, the file map and the guard name live in ONE place:
 * see "THE THREE TIERS" in gpon_common.h (this directory).
 * Guard: dev/rtl9607c-test/gpon_layer_hostbuild_test.sh (suite step 17) —
 * it COMPILES this tier against stubs that declare no register accessor,
 * no clock, no lock and no allocator, so impurity cannot build.
 *
 * gpon_omci_core.h — the ITU-T G.988 OMCI baseline MESSAGE layer, common to
 * every OpenWrt GPON target in this tree.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 *   The wire half of the ONU's OMCI responder: the baseline PDU facts (message
 *   types, result codes, the 48-octet frame, the attribute-mask bit rule), the
 *   parse of a downstream request, the dispatch by message type, and the
 *   construction of the upstream response — trailer and MIC included.
 *   It holds NO managed-entity storage.  The ME model (descriptor table, board
 *   identity blob, MIB-Upload rows) and the dynamic OLT-created instance store
 *   live in the ME-model layer, which this layer CALLS and never inlines.  The
 *   seam is deliberate: G.988 message rules are the same on every ONU ever
 *   built, while which MEs a product serves is per board.
 *
 * WHY IT IS COMMON — and which targets and architectures compile it
 *   Operator, 2026-08-05: "en openwrt debería estar estructurado algo así:
 *   rtl960x* para la familia para tener código común" … "la idea es poner en
 *   común el código que corresponde para no tener mucho duplicado", and on the
 *   two per-target monoliths carrying a private copy each: "mal, poner en
 *   común".
 *   G.988 is a specification, not a chip fact, so exactly ONE copy of it may
 *   exist in the tree.  Compiled by:
 *     - realtek-elnath (RTL9607F, Cortina)   aarch64, LITTLE-endian  — today
 *     - realtek-luna   (RTL960xC, Luna)      MIPS32,  BIG-endian     — after
 *       follow-ups F1/F2/F3 only.  Luna ships a third, independently written
 *       responder (rtl9602c_eth.c) that diverges on the wire from this one;
 *       switching it over CHANGES LUNA'S EMITTED BYTES, so it is a behaviour
 *       change with its own board gate and was deliberately NOT part of the
 *       code-motion refactor that created this file.  Each divergence is
 *       named at the constant it concerns, below and in the .c.
 *     - dev/rtl9607c-test on x86-64 through fuzz_shims/, where it is fuzzed
 *       under ASan+UBSan thousands of cases per second
 *   The prefix is gpon_ and not luna_ on purpose: the layer must also serve
 *   the future ARM OLT and other brands, so a Realtek-named prefix would be
 *   too narrow for what it covers.
 *
 * THE CORE/SHELL RULE IT OBEYS
 *   FUNCTIONAL CORE.  It decides; it never does.  It parses wire bytes, applies
 *   the message rules and fills a caller-provided buffer.  No device pointer,
 *   no lock (the caller serialises), no allocation, no sleeping, no clock read.
 *   Every byte of state lives in the caller-provided struct omci_onu.  The
 *   imperative shell (cortina-gpon.c on Elnath, rtl9602c_eth.c on Luna) owns
 *   the OMCC/GEM binding, the TX ring, the counters and the /proc view.
 *
 *   ⇒ THIS FILE AND ITS .c MUST NEVER GAIN AN MMIO ACCESS.  No readl/writel,
 *   no ioremap, no msleep/udelay, no jiffies, no spin_lock/mutex, no kmalloc,
 *   no dev_ or netdev_ logging.  The purity check greps for exactly that set
 *   and the gate goes red if one appears.  It is not hygiene: that property is
 *   what makes the layer host-compilable, host-fuzzable, and portable across
 *   the two architectures at once.
 *
 * ENDIANNESS
 *   All wire access is explicit byte math — ((u16)p[0] << 8) | p[1] — never a
 *   struct or pointer cast over wire bytes, and never htons/ntohs on a buffer.
 *   That is not style: it is the reason ONE source compiles for big-endian
 *   MIPS and little-endian ARM64 and emits the same octets on both.
