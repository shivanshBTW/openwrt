 * gpon_common.h — THE CONTRACT between the HW-decoupled GPON protocol core and
 * the per-target imperative shell.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 *   The shared types the common GPON layer is built on: the canonical ONU
 *   state encoding, the G.988/G.984 wire enumerations the core decides on, the
 *   per-chip fact block, and `struct gpon_shell_ops` — the table of function
 *   pointers through which the core asks a shell to touch hardware.
 *
 * WHY IT IS COMMON — operator, 2026-08-05:
 *   "en openwrt debería estar estructurado algo así: rtl960x* para la familia
 *    para tener código común" · "la idea es poner en común el código que
 *    corresponde para no tener mucho duplicado" · on the two monoliths: "mal,
 *    poner en común".
 *   Compiled by BOTH OpenWrt targets, on two architectures and two byte orders:
 *     - realtek-luna   — RTL9602C/9603C/9607C, MIPS32 big-endian (Lexra/RLX)
 *     - realtek-elnath — RTL9607F "Elnath" (Cortina), ARM64 little-endian
 *   and additionally on x86 by the differential suite in dev/rtl9607c-test/,
 *   through the host shims in dev/rtl9607c-test/fuzz_shims/. The prefix is
 *   `gpon_` and deliberately NOT `luna_`: this layer must also serve the
 *   future ARM OLT and other vendors' hardware, so a Realtek-named prefix
 *   would be too narrow.
 *
 * ★★ THE THREE TIERS — WHICH FILE MAY HOLD WHAT.  THIS IS THE CANONICAL COPY.
 *   Every other file the 2026-08-05 refactor touched or created carries a
 *   ONE-LINE "TIER:" header pointing here, and nothing more: the rule is
 *   written out once, so it can be corrected once.  Do not restate it.
 *
 *   The project rule it implements: "name each file by the NARROWEST prefix
 *   that matches everything it targets".  Widening a file's prefix without
 *   widening its content is how chip facts end up in a family file.
 *
 *     TIER    prefix                       holds                    may touch HW
 *     ------  ---------------------------  -----------------------  ------------
 *     core    gpon_                        LOGIC that is not one     NO — never
 *                                          family's: the PLOAM FSM,
 *                                          G.988 OMCI + ME model,
 *                                          GEM/T-CONT mapping, wire
 *                                          codecs, and (since
 *                                          2026-08-28) driver logic
 *                                          that touches no register
 *                                          even when it uses Linux.
 *                                          Decides; never addresses.
 *
 *   ★★★ THE CORE WIDENED ON 2026-08-28, BY THE OPERATOR, AND WHY IT HAD TO.
 *   The tier above used to say "protocol only", and the measurement that forced
 *   the change is worth keeping: what pins code into a family is NOT the
 *   hardware.  `cn_flow_replace` is 347 lines with ZERO register accesses and
 *   could not move, because it allocates, takes netdev references and drives an
 *   rhashtable -- and the old rule barred those.  Read across both families,
 *   that is the shape of most of the code: netdev, napi, skb, TC offload,
 *   timers.  Barring Linux from the core did not keep hardware out; it kept
 *   SHARED DRIVER LOGIC in two copies, one per family.
 *
 *   ⇒ the line is now exactly one thing: **does it name a register or reach a
 *   bus?**  If not, it is a candidate for the core however much Linux it uses.
 *
 *   ⚠⚠ AND THE STRICT SUBSET IS NOT NEGOTIABLE, because it is what this project
 *   PROVES things with.  These files stay free of Linux APIs as well as of
 *   MMIO, so they keep building for x86 and keep being fuzzed under
 *   libFuzzer/ASan/UBSan at thousands of cases per second -- the gate that
 *   DISCOVERS, against a board boot that only CONFIRMS:
 *
 *       gpon_ploam.[hc]   gpon_omci_core.[hc]   gpon_omci_me.[hc]
 *       gpon_gem_us.[hc]  gpon_sn.[hc]          gpon_regseq.[hc]
 *
 *   A file in that list may not gain an allocator, a lock, a device pointer, a
 *   timer or a sleep.  New core code that needs Linux is a NEW file beside
 *   them, never an edit to one of them.  `gpon_layer_hostbuild_test.sh` is what
 *   makes that a fact rather than an intention: it builds the list on the host,
 *   and it goes red the day one of them stops being buildable there.

 *
 *   ⚠ TWO TIER TRAPS ALREADY PAID FOR, both measured on 2026-08-05:
 *     - luna_ponmac.c LOOKS like the family protocol home because of its
 *       prefix, and is not: it implements ZERO of the ops below (measured —
 *       the file contains no PLOAM, GEM, alloc, ONU-ID, EqD, AES or BOH
 *       identifier at all).  It is family HARDWARE, one tier below the shells.
 *     - a core file with no consumer is worse than duplication.  gpon_proto.c
 *       was a previous attempt at this same refactor, left unwired; it drifted
 *       until its code contradicted its own comment, and it was deleted in this
 *       refactor rather than revived.  A gpon_ file that nothing calls is dead
 *       weight in a 3 MB NAND kernel and a fork waiting to happen.
 *
 * THE CORE / SHELL RULE THIS FILE OBEYS (functional core, imperative shell)
 *   CORE  decides. It parses wire bytes, runs the FSM, builds reply buffers and
 *         holds the ME model. It NEVER performs I/O.
 *   SHELL does. It reads and writes registers, arms DMA, services interrupts,
 *         drives the PON MAC — and calls the core through this table.
 *   Three rules follow, and they are what make the core replayable and fuzzable:
 *     1. A side effect leaves as a RETURN VALUE wherever it can. An op exists
 *        only for what a return value cannot express. (This is why there is no
 *        "send" op invoked from inside a decision: a core entry point returns
 *        what it decided and the shell drains it.)
 *     2. TIME IS AN INPUT, never read. Core entry points take an explicit
 *        millisecond/tick argument. No jiffies, no ktime, no timers, no sleeping.
 *     3. Per-chip facts arrive as `const struct gpon_chip_cfg *`, never #ifdef.
 *
 * ★ THIS FILE, AND EVERY gpon_*.[ch] BESIDE IT, MUST NEVER GAIN AN MMIO ACCESS.
 *   No readl/writel/ioremap, no msleep/udelay, no spin_lock/mutex, no kmalloc,
 *   no dev_* or netdev_* or pr_* logging, no jiffies, no schedule_work, and no
 *   struct device.
 *   A shell detail that reaches this header is a defect in the header, not a
 *   fact about the hardware — express it as an op or as a `gpon_chip_cfg`
 *   member.
 *
 *   ★ THE GUARD, BY NAME — AND IT IS A COMPILER, NOT A GREP:
 *       dev/rtl9607c-test/gpon_layer_hostbuild_test.sh --LABEL="<name>"
 *       (suite step 17; run by run_steps.sh and by `make all`)
 *     It compiles every gpon_ source in this directory on the host against the
 *     kernel-type stubs in dev/rtl9607c-test/fuzz_shims, and those stubs are
 *     the enforcement: they deliberately declare NO register accessor, NO
 *     clock, NO lock, NO allocator, NO work/timer and NO net_device.  A core
 *     file that reaches for hardware therefore FAILS TO COMPILE.  It also
 *     refuses to pass vacuously — zero sources found is a FAIL, so "the layer
 *     is pure" and "there is no layer" can never look the same.
 *     Measured 2026-08-05: 5 pass, 0 fail, over 4 core sources.
 *
 *   ⚠ A TOKEN GREP IS THE WRONG INSTRUMENT HERE, AND THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE IS
 *     THE PROOF.  It NAMES every forbidden token, so a raw scan scores 5 on
 *     this file and 0 on its code (2026-08-05: `grep -cE` = 5; the same
 *     pattern after `gcc -fpreprocessed -dD -E` = 0).  Three independent
 *     authors hit this on the same day.  A guard that fails the file which
 *     DOCUMENTS the rule is the "matching TEXT where STRUCTURE is meant"
 *     defect aimed at itself — and the same scan would MISS a real register
 *     access that a stray comment terminator had exposed, which is exactly
 *     what the first compile of this header caught (a `*` followed by `/`
 *     inside `dev_` + `netdev_` closed the block comment early: prose, not
 *     code, and no grep would have found it).
 *
 *   ⚠ `gpon_core_purity_test` IS NAMED BY TWO BUILD SCRIPTS AND DOES NOT
 *     EXIST.  gpon-common/build_wiring_guard.py:24 and
 *     gpon-common/build_wiring_x86_check.sh:18 both defer the purity half to
 *     "gpon_core_purity_test in dev/rtl9607c-test/"; verified 2026-08-05,
 *     there is no such file, target or suite step, and nothing else in the
 *     tree names it.  Do NOT read those references as a check that ran.  It is
 *     OWED work, not coverage: if it is ever written it MUST strip comments
 *     first, per the paragraph above.  Today the compile guard is the coverage.
 *
 * ENDIANNESS
 *   One source serves MIPS-BE and ARM64-LE. Nothing here overlays a struct on
 *   wire bytes; the wire enumerations below are single octets, and multi-octet
 *   fields are assembled by the cores with explicit byte math ((d[1]<<8)|d[2]).
 *   Never add a packed struct, a pointer cast over a wire buffer, or an
 *   htons/ntohs to this layer.
 *
 * PROVENANCE
 *   Written for the plan at dev/sdk-facts/00-COMMON-LAYER-PLAN.md (2026-08-05).
 *   Every op below was verified against the shell function that implements it
 *   today; the file:line evidence is quoted per member. Where the plan's
 *   proposed shape did not match the measured source, the measurement wins and
 *   the divergence is named in the comment.

 *   - `data_gem_port` (luna's compile-time GPON_DATA_GEM 193 vs elnath's
 *     snooped id) is an ARGUMENT to the data install, not a core fact
 *     (carve-eln-gem §5.4);
 *   - `gem_flow_base` / `gem_flow_count` are shell-internal tokens. The
 *     internal GEM index is arithmetically tied to elnath's PUC VoQ map
 *     (CG_DATA_GEM_IDX = CG_DATA_TCONT_IDX * 8, cortina-gpon.c:321) and is a
 *     flat GTC constant on luna (GPON_OMCC_FLOW 64, GPON_DATA_FLOW 1). Common
 *     code that computes a flow is wrong on one of the two targets, so the core
 *     never sees one (carve-eln-gem §5.2);
 *   - `omcc_tcont` / `data_tcont` are silicon T-CONT INDICES the shell writes
 *     into a CAM (luna 16/8; elnath 0/1, cortina-gpon.c:2044/:320). The core

 *   because plan D-3 rules that realtek-luna does NOT switch to the common
 *   responder in this refactor — doing so would change its wire bytes on a
 *   board that is off the rig. These members are the hook that lets it switch
 *   later WITHOUT changing those bytes, and each is consumed by the follow-up
 *   named on its line. Until then, a target needing a non-default value must
 *   not use the common responder. Do not add a member here without the code
 *   that reads it: a knob that silently does nothing is this project's most

 * The op table — everything the core cannot do for itself
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * @sh is the shell's opaque handle (realtek-elnath passes its `struct
 * cortina_gpon *`; realtek-luna passes NULL while its state is still
 * file-scope). It is void * so that no target's device struct can reach this
 * header.
 *
 * CALL CONTEXT — two classes, and mixing them is the single largest
 * correctness risk in the whole carve (carve-eln-gem §5.1):
 *   *_decide() core entry points may be called from SOFTIRQ. They must not
 *             sleep and must not take a lock. On realtek-elnath the OMCI snoop
 *             runs in NAPI softirq and publishes to the work context with
 *             WRITE_ONCE/READ_ONCE and no lock at all.
 *   *_apply()  core entry points run in PROCESS context only, and are the ONLY
 *             callers of an op that may block, poll or time out.
 * ⇒ Putting a mutex in common state would break the softirq caller
 *   (might_sleep); a spinlock would be a behaviour change. Neither is done.
 *
 * ORDERING FACTS THE CORE MAY REQUEST BUT MUST NEVER PERFORM:
 *   - teardown ORDER is a hardware fact. realtek-elnath must drain the VoQ
 *     before the CAM moves under the PUC scheduler (cortina-gpon.c:2113
 *     cg_data_teardown, the vendor drain-then-clear order); realtek-luna's
 *     sequence differs. The core says "tear down"; the shell decides how.
 *   - the deferred-work kick fires from INSIDE realtek-elnath's snoop
 *     (cortina-gpon.c:2751/:2773/:2794) BEFORE the responder runs at :2809.
 *     That position is load-bearing and stays shell-side, unchanged.
 *
 * ERROR CONVENTION: an int-returning op returns 0 on success or a negative
 * errno. -ETIMEDOUT is REACHABLE and the core must handle it — every hardware
 * table write on realtek-elnath goes through cg_tbl_op's bounded completion
 * poll (cortina-gpon.c:1977), and realtek-luna's CAM writes poll likewise. A
 * core that assumes an install succeeded leaves silicon carrying a binding its
 * shadow does not record.
 *
 * A NULL op means "this target does not have that hardware step" and the core
 * must skip it, not fail. This is not hypothetical: realtek-luna has no
 * downstream-GEM CAM teardown at all (its stale-CAM story is a re-arm flag),
 * so ->data_teardown is NULL there (carve-eln-gem §5.4).
