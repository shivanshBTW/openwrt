/*
 * luna_ponmac.c - clean-room RTL960x family GPON PON-MAC / SerDes bring-up.
 *
 * This is an ORIGINAL, data-driven reimplementation. The per-chip register
 * SEQUENCES (which registers, what values, in what order, with what delays) are
 * hardware-interface FACTS dictated by the silicon - extracted by observing the
 * bring-up - not copied code. They are expressed here as compact declarative
 * op-tables driven by a single tiny interpreter, rather than as repetitive
 * per-register procedural boilerplate. The structure, interpreter,
 * naming, and organization are all original; only the factual register data is
 * shared with any other implementation of the same hardware.
 *
 * Design (deliberately "better code"):
 *   - one r960_op{} table per (chip, phase) = the bring-up as data
 *   - r960_run() interprets WR / FLD(RMW) / DELAY / POLL ops
 *   - loops/conditionals (scheduler & queue init, rev/subtype branches) stay as
 *     small explicit code - tables are only for straight-line register runs
 *   - absolute physical addresses throughout; the board injects rd/wr (ops)
 *
 * Tested: the 9602C path on the X111W and the 9603CVD path on the G24W.  The
 * 9607C path is register-faithful but UNTESTED (no board on the bench).
 *
 * REMOVED 2026-08-29, and the removal is the point: this file also carried a
 * complete RTL9601B bring-up and a complete EPON mode-set for all four chips
 * -- 897 lines, every one of them UNTESTED BY ITS OWN ADMISSION ("no EPON
 * hardware available").  Nothing referenced LUNA_CHIP_9601B or
 * LUNA_MODE_EPON outside this file; every live caller passed
 * LUNA_MODE_GPON, so the mode parameter has gone with them.  We ship a GPON
 * product; code for a protocol we do not ship, on silicon we do not have, is
 * not a spare part -- it is 897 lines a reader must first prove irrelevant.
 *
 * ===================================================================== *
 * WHERE THE GPON PROTOCOL LAYER IS - AND WHY IT IS NOT IN THIS FILE
 * (navigation note, 2026-08-05 common-layer refactor. No code moved out of
 *  this file; this block exists so the next reader does not go looking.)
 *
 * If you arrived here from the operator's brief - "rtl960x* para la familia
 * para tener codigo comun" - this IS that file, but for the HARDWARE tier
 * only, and it is already doing the job: one object serves two chip drivers
 * (the Makefile links luna_ponmac.o under BOTH CONFIG_RTL9602C_GPON and
 * CONFIG_RTL9607C_GPON) and carries four chips' tables behind one
 * enum luna_chip dispatch. There is nothing to de-duplicate here.
 *
 * The 2026-08-05 refactor added a SECOND, HIGHER contract - the HW-decoupled
 * GPON protocol core and its op table:
 *     target/linux/gpon-common/files-6.18/drivers/net/gpon/gpon_common.h
 *     struct gpon_shell_ops   (14 ops: ploam_tx, set_hw_state, set_hw_onu_id,
 *                              set_eqd, apply_boh, analog_relock,
 *                              aes_stage_key, aes_set_switch_time, rng,
 *                              omcc_install, data_install, data_teardown,
 *                              omci_tx, trace)
 *
 * NONE of those 14 ops is implemented here, and none can be. Measured
 * 2026-08-05 over this file: ploam 0, gem 0, alloc 0, onu_id 0, eqd 0, aes 0,
 * boh 0 occurrences. The 34 "OMCI" and 28 "T-CONT" hits are REGISTER NAMES
 * and EGRESS-SCHEDULER SLOTS - the trap priority, and which physical queue
 * the OMCC channel is steered to (C7_OMCI_FLOW / C7_OMCI_TCONT /
 * C7_OMCI_QUEUE). This file never sees a PLOAM or OMCI message, never learns
 * an ONU-ID, an alloc-id or a GEM port-id, and holds no FSM. It configures
 * the pipe; it never reads what flows through it.
 *
 * Luna's implementation of gpon_shell_ops lives where those ops actually are,
 * which is gpon-rtl960x.c, plus rtl9602c_eth.c for the OMCI transmit. That
 * is the file the Luna op-table instance belongs in - NOT this one. The
 * implementing functions, each verified present at the line given
 * (2026-08-05):
 *     ploam_tx        :5041  gpon_send_cpu_ploam()
 *     aes_stage_key   :5180  gpon_aes_stage_key()
 *     omcc_install    :5420  gpon_install_omcc()
 *     data_install    :5609  gpon_install_data_gem()
 *     apply_boh       :5947  gpon_apply_boh()
 *     set_eqd         :6017  gpon_set_eqd()
 *     analog_relock   :6053  gpon_txpll_relock()
 *     set_hw_state    :6068  gpon_fsm_set_state()
 * Two entries are NOT stand-alone functions, and are listed apart so nobody
 * goes looking for one:
 *     :5765  gpon_install_tcont() is a helper BOTH omcc_install and
 *            data_install call to bind their T-CONT; it is not an op itself.
 *     :6499  aes_set_switch_time has no function - it is an inline
 *            gpon_wr(0x3014, fc) (AES_KEY_SWITCH_TIME[29:0]) inside the
 *            KEY_SW PLOAM handler, guarded by gpon_key_staged. Whoever wires
 *            that op has to lift it out first; the guard must come with it.
 *     data_teardown has no Luna implementation at all - the op is NULL here
 *            (gpon_common.h says so; luna's stale-CAM story is a re-arm flag).
 *
 * TIER RELATIONSHIP, stated once so it is not re-derived:
 *     gpon_*        protocol core - decides, no MMIO, runs on x86 too
 *     gpon-rtl960x.c / cortina-gpon.c   the two SHELLS - they implement
 *                                        gpon_shell_ops and do the I/O
 *     luna_ponmac.c (this file) / the Cortina NE bring-up
 *                                        a tier BELOW both shells: silicon
 *                                        bring-up the shell calls at probe
 * So this file is a PEER of the Cortina bring-up, never a base class for it,
 * and nothing is promoted out of it. The two silicons share no register.
 *
 * ! DO NOT ADD a struct gpon_shell_ops instance to this file. It could only
 *   be a table of pointers into gpon-rtl960x.c's statics, which needs either
 *   12 symbols un-static'd or a runtime registration - a redesign, not code
 *   motion - and it would have no caller here. A shared-looking file with no
 *   consumer is exactly what gpon_proto.c became (dead since 2026-06-18,
 *   deleted by the refactor); do not build a second one.
 * ! DO NOT merge struct luna_ops (below) into gpon_shell_ops. It is a raw
 *   REGISTER ACCESSOR {rd, wr} injected so this file needs no struct device.
 *   It is a different contract at a different tier that happens to share the
 *   word "ops".
 *
 * Two things found while verifying the above. Recorded, deliberately NOT
 * fixed - this pass is code motion, and both are pre-existing:
 *   N1. luna_ponmac_serdes_cdr_reset() (the exported dispatcher at the
 *       bottom of this file) has ZERO callers tree-wide. The live CDR reset
 *       is gpon-rtl960x.c:3153's own inline pulse under its serdes_cdr_reset
 *       module param. Kept as-is: it is the family API for the boards not on
 *       the bench, the same status as the untested 9607C tables.
 *   N2. That CDR reset is NOT the analog_relock op, despite the similar name.
 *       Different registers, different purpose: CDR reset pulses
 *       SDS_ANA_COM_REG12 bit15, while analog_relock is
 *       gpon-rtl960x.c:6053 gpon_txpll_relock(), which toggles
 *       SDS_ANA_COM_REG27 bit10 (CMU enable 1->0->1) and re-syncs the SerDes
 *       word-FIFO pointer via WSDS_DIG_1D bit14. Wiring analog_relock to the
 *       CDR reset would silently replace the cold-start TX-CMU relock this
 *       board's ranging depends on.

	 * reasoning that `c3_sds_pre` deselects the RX CDR AFE and nothing put it
	 * back, and that the 9602C's own path sets the identically-named field on

	 * PROVEN: stock's resting value for this bit on THIS board. If a stock
	 * capture later shows 0 here, this line is the first suspect."*
	 *
	 * THE CAPTURE WAS TAKEN. Stock, on THIS board, at O5 [Operation, SERVING],
	 * SWCORE 0x4058c:
	 *
	 *     SDS_ANA_COM03 = 0x00001929   ->   bit 13 = 0
	 *
	 * and in the same capture SDS_FIB_STATUS (0x214) = 0x00020008, i.e. SDS_SDET
	 * (bit 17) SET. So the RX front end raises signal-detect on this silicon
	 * with COM03[13] resting at ZERO, and the premise of the arm -- that an
	 * unselected AFE is why SDS_SDET stays 0 on our image -- is refuted by the
	 * only source that could refute it.
	 *
	 * The board had already said the same thing more weakly: the arm was in the
	 * image booted 2026-08-26 (provable -- the `optic_a2:` line only that build
	 * prints appeared) and sds_sdet stayed 0, link_ok stayed 0, and the FSM
	 * stayed at O1.
	 *
	 * ⇒ the value is left where c3_sds_pre puts it, which is also where stock
	 * leaves it. The DLY(10) that settled the selection goes with it.
