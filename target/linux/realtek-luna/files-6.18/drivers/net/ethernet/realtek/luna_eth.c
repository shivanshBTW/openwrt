 * Realtek Luna (MIPS interAptiv) GMAC0 + on-chip switch — eth0.
 *
 * Clean-room driver for the SoC's CPU-port Gigabit MAC (the "GMAC0" engine at
 * phys 0x18012000) and a minimal open-L2 bring-up of the on-chip switch core
 * (phys 0x1b000000). The CPU reaches the LAN only through the switch:
 *
 *	CPU <-> GMAC0 (eth0) <-> switch CPU-port <-> physical LAN port <-> wire
 *
 * ★★ WHY THIS FILE IS NAMED luna_* AND NOT rtl9607c_*.
 * It serves TWO chips, and the project's naming rule is explicit: family-shared
 * code may not hide behind one chip's name, because the next human or LLM has to
 * land on the work BY NAME. It was renamed the day the second chip was proven to
 * use it, not later. The chip-specific half is a TABLE (`struct luna_eth_chip`),
 * never an `#ifdef` and never a second copy of the file — a duplicated driver is
 * how a repair lands on one board and not the others.
 *
 *	RTL9607C   engineering board, 11 switch ports, 3 CPU GMACs, SerDes uplink
 *	RTL9603CVD LANLY G24W,         6 switch ports, 1 CPU GMAC,  no SerDes
 *
 * ★ THE MAC ENGINE IS IDENTICAL ON BOTH; THE SWITCH REGISTERS ARE NOT.
 * The vendor compiles ONE NIC source for both parts, from one header, and takes
 * the register base from its device tree — so base, every MAC offset, both
 * descriptor layouts, the interrupt bits and the DMA model carry over unchanged
 * [tier 3, the chips' own 4.4.140 SDK]. The SWITCH is a different story: of 1361
 * name-matched switch registers, 853 keep their offset and **508 move**. The
 * ability block is the trap that pays for this table — the RTL9607C's `P_ABLTY`
 * at 0x200 is `SDS_CFG` on the RTL9603CVD, so a driver that "just worked
 * because the family is the same" would be reading a SerDes configuration word
 * and calling it a link state.
 *
 * Switch bring-up facts (behavioural, established on the RTL9607C):
 *  - The CPU port is this GMAC; the LAN copper ports and the fibre/PON port are
 *    per chip (see the table).
 *  - ★ THE LOAD-BEARING RX GATE IS THE PER-PORT SPANNING-TREE STATE
 *    (`MSTI_CTRL`), not a permit mask. An earlier version of this comment said
 *    the bootloader leaves a "source permit" mask cleared and that opening it
 *    was the fix — that is RETRACTED. `SRC_PORT_PERMIT` is a per-source-port
 *    egress-FILTER ENABLE whose forwarding-permissive value is 0 (its own reset
 *    value); writing all-ones there silently dropped every LAN->CPU frame.
 *  - ⚠ AND THE SILICON IS NOT THE ONE THAT BLOCKS: `MSTI_CTRL` resets to
 *    0x000000FF on BOTH chips, i.e. every port FORWARDING. If ports are found
 *    non-forwarding at probe, that is the BOOT LOADER's doing, not a reset
 *    state — so the write below is a correction, not an initialisation, and it
 *    must stay even if a future bootloader stops needing it.
 *  - The integrated copper PHYs need no analog calibration on either chip; the
 *    deterministic path is MAC-force-link every port plus open-L2 flood.
 *  - The ordered sequence matters: replaying only the final register values is
 *    not sufficient on this hardware.

 * Running `dal_rtl9603cvd_switch_init` under Unicorn showed the vendor write the

 * low addresses `0x0020`-`0x003E` ONLY for the FE *patch* register block on

 * register -- which settles a contradiction this file's own comment called
 * unresolved.
 * With `gphy_map = 0` and this chip's `gphy_ports = 0x08`, our BMCR and
 * AN-restart writes on THREE of the four copper ports went to flat `0x0000`
 * where the vendor uses `0xA400`.
 * ⚠ A SINGLE-VARIABLE EXPERIMENT, not a proven fix: the previous three
 * candidates (the RxCDO store width, the force-every-UTP-port policy, the GPHY
 * reset) were each plausible and each REFUTED by measurement. `gphy_map=0` is
 * one bootarg away, so this is reversible without a rebuild.

 * which the switch ran with the wrong MDIO base. The GPON driver now skips
 * that recipe on this chip, so there is nothing left to repair and the write
 * below is a no-op that merely asserts the value.
 * Beside that, every PHY read here returns 0000 with BUSY never once
 * asserting, while the identical window on stock holds a real datum
 * (GPHY_IND_RD = 0x1940, a BMCR with PDOWN set). If the indirect GPHY access

 *   piso        same BASE, different SHAPE: 12-bit masks packed TWO PORTS PER

 *               (11 ports + 18 ext). Both tile exactly, which is the
 *               cross-check that makes the packing believable rather than
 *               guessed.
 *
 * ★ AND `fephy_poll` HAS NO 9607C COUNTERPART AT ALL. Its reset value stops
 * the FE-PHY auto-poller, so the switch never learns FE link state until
 * somebody clears bit 16 -- the chip's own U-Boot does exactly that, and a

	 *
	 * which is the register's RESET VALUE, i.e. PWRUP[8:5] = 0 -- all four
	 * PHY macros UNPOWERED. That is why every PHY register reads 0000, why
	 * no UTP port links, and why nothing enters the switch.
	 *
	 * It was not always 0. In the SAME boot, minutes earlier, U-Boot moved
	 * 4.1 MB through port 3 by TFTP: the switch's own MIB counted 2823
	 * unicast frames against a 2824-packet transfer, with port 5 carrying
	 * the matching ACKs. The PHY linked, the switch forwarded both ways --
	 * and the counters FREEZE the instant this driver takes over.
	 *
	 * ⚠⚠ THE MECHANISM I EXPECTED IS REFUTED, BY THIS VERY LOG LINE. I
	 * thought the pulse below cleared PWRUP and that nothing restored it.
	 * The first boot with this code printed
	 *
	 *     CFG_PHY_INI(0x050) 00000200 -> 00000200 across the GPHY reset,
	 *                        restored to 00000200 (read back 00000200)
	 *
	 * -- the value was ALREADY 0x200 going in. The reset does not clear it,
	 * and U-Boot leaves it at 0x200 as well. So U-Boot moved 4.1 MB through
	 * these PHYs with PWRUP reading zero: on this board PWRUP[8:5] is NOT
	 * the gate that powers a GPHY, whatever the field name suggests.
	 * ⇒ PWRUP = 0 is NOT the fault, and nobody should re-chase it.
	 *
	 * ★ THE SAVE/RESTORE STAYS ANYWAY, and it is not superstition: it is a
	 * reset-domain re-lock, the shape this project's anti-repeat list names
	 * first, and it costs one read and one write. It copies forward whatever
	 * the bootloader and the efuse agreed on rather than inventing a value,
	 * so it stays correct on a board where the reset DOES clear it. What
	 * earns its keep here is the LOG: it refuted a plausible hypothesis in a
	 * single boot instead of a bisect.
	 *
	 * ★ The vendor never pulses this reset at all in its own switch_init
	 * (tier 2: index 0x000E0 is written only by `chip_reset` and
	 * `ponmac_mode_set`), so not pulsing is the other candidate repair --
	 * kept separate, because one change at a time is what makes a bisect
	 * mean something.
