 * US-OMCI TX tuning knobs (see rtl9602c_eth_omci_xmit).
 *
 * The authoritative stock 9602C OMCI-TX path builds a 5-word "txInfo"
 * descriptor and submits it on a dedicated TX ring with a per-ring poll
 * doorbell. Two of the field values are derived at runtime by the stock
 * firmware from internal GPON state we do not mirror exactly:
 *   - the PON_SID one-hot SHIFT (the stock reads a GEM-SID-index global and
 *     emits a one-hot 1<<idx into word3[28:23]); the right small index for our
 *     single OMCC flow is unknown from the descriptor build alone, so expose it.
 *   - the PON port (ExtSpa) placed in word3[22:16]; our PON switch port is 2.
 *
 * HW-RING / DOORBELL (observed from the stock device's TX-submit behavior):
 * stock submits with a SW ring number and maps it to a HW ring via
 *   idx_sw2hw(ring) = 4 - ring   ("HW ring h").
 * The per-packet kick then targets that SAME HW ring h:
 *   if (h < 4)  R_IO_CMD  |= (1 << h);
 *   if (h == 4) R_IO_CMD1 |= 0x100;
 * and the descriptor ring lives at R_TxFDP(h) = 0x1300 + h*16. So all three
 * (descriptor ring, TxFDP arm, doorbell) MUST reference the SAME HW ring h.
 *
 * omci_tx_ring below is the HW ring number directly (it indexes R_TxFDP(h) and
 * derives the doorbell from the same h). Stock OMCI = SW ring 4 = HW ring 0; but
 * our LAN/normal-xmit path already owns HW ring 0 (R_TxFDP1=0x1300, kick R_IO_CMD
 * bit0), so to avoid a collision we place the US-OMCI on a FREE HW ring (default
 * HW ring 4: TxFDP 0x1340, kick R_IO_CMD1 |= 0x100). The encoding is identical;
 * only the ring instance differs. Kept tunable for HW bring-up.
 */
/*
 * PON_SID one-hot SHIFT for the OMCC US flow (word3[28:23] = ((1<<idx)&0x3F)<<23).
 *
 * Default 4 from clean-room study of the stock device's OMCI-TX behavior + a live-stock cross-check:
 *   - the stock OMCI-TX path builds the steering exactly as we do:
 *       v0=1; v0 <<= sid_idx; v0 &= 0x3F; v0 <<= 0x17(23)   -> word3[28:23] one-hot
 *       (sid_idx comes from internal GPON state, dereferenced from a per-flow
 *        mirror; the first descriptor builder reads the same value from that mirror).
 *     The value is PROVISIONED at OMCC GEM install (the setter just copies
 *     a caller-supplied word into the mirror), so it is NOT a baked constant — it
 *     is a small table index into the 6-way PON_SID classifier.
 *   - DECISIVE cross-check: a prior live-stock read showed US RX_SID_GOOD for SID 64
 *     increments group [4] (RX_SID_GOOD_CNT_US 0x204c). The 6-bit one-hot [28:23]
 *     selects one of the 6 classify slots whose good-counters are groups [0..4]
 *     (0x203c/0x2040/0x2044/0x2048/0x204c); the only one-hot bit that routes SID 64
 *     into group [4] is bit 4 => sid_idx = 4. The old default 0 emitted one-hot bit
 *     0 (group [0] @0x203c), so our OMCI never reached the SID-64 classify slot

/* OMCI MIB-Data-Sync (ME 2 attr 1) seed. THE PROVISIONING GATE.
 *
 * ★★ THE GATE IS AN *OR*, AND THIS COMMENT USED TO STATE IT BACKWARDS. Read out
 * of the OLT's own decompiled `gpon_ont_cfg_process` (HSGQ-G008 gpondev) on
 * 2026-08-16, the branch that reaches "start issue auth profile" -- i.e. the
 * MIB-Reset + Create burst that gives us a data GEM -- is taken when ANY of:
 *
 *      rsync == 0  ||  rsync != lsync  ||  rsync < 31  ||  <ont field> == 2
 *
 * where rsync is the ME2 MIB-Data-Sync we report at the OLT's pre-config Get and
 * lsync is the value the OLT holds for this ONT. So the OLT provisions when the
 * MIB is NOT in sync -- which is the opposite of what this comment claimed
 * ("installs the downstream gem flow ONLY when rsync==lsync && rsync>30"). The
 * `>30` was real but its SENSE was inverted: being BELOW 31 is a REASON to
 * provision, never a requirement to skip.
 *
 * ⇒ SO THE SEED IS DERIVED, NOT GUESSED. Any value in 1..30 satisfies the third
 * clause NO MATTER what the OLT has stored, so it cannot be defeated by a stale
 * lsync.
 *
 * ★★ AND WHY NOT 0, WHICH IS WHAT STOCK REPORTS. Two independent RE passes over
 * the vendor's own omci_app (2026-08-16) agree that stock does NOT persist this
 * counter -- `gMibOntDataDefRow` sits in .bss with no initialiser and is
 * explicitly zeroed in mibTable_init -- so stock answers 0 at the OLT's
 * pre-config Get on every boot, which satisfies the gate's FIRST clause. That
 * also refutes this driver's older claim that "stock persists its mds so rsync
 * matches": it does not, and nothing here should rest on that sentence again.
 *
 * By the stock-is-the-oracle rule the seed should therefore be 0. It is 7
 * instead, and the reason is a CONFLICT this project's rules resolve in favour
 * of the measurement: our own note at the mds_reset0 param records mds=0 wedging
 * THIS OLT in a Get poll loop. That observation was never explained, and it is
 * contradicted from three directions (stock reports 0; the OLT's gate takes
 * rsync==0 as its first provisioning clause; no persistence exists to make it
 * otherwise) -- but a decompilation does not overrule an observation, it only
 * makes it suspect. 7 satisfies a DIFFERENT clause of the same gate, so it is
 * correct under both readings and touches nothing in dispute.
 *
 * ⇒ OWED, AND IT IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT MORE RE: boot stock on this PON port and
 * capture what it actually answers to the pre-config ME2 Get. If it reports 0
 * and is provisioned, the wedge note is wrong and this seed becomes 0 -- exactly
 * matching stock. Until that capture exists, the adaptive walk below is what
 * covers the gap, and it costs nothing when provisioning works.
 *
 * ★ WHY THE OLD VALUE FAILED, MEASURED 2026-08-16 -- the poison poisoned itself.
 * The seed was 200, chosen to "not match any plausible stored lsync". Once this
 * ONU had reported 200, the OLT stored 200 as ITS lsync for the record; from
 * then on rsync == lsync == 200, 200 >= 31, and every clause was false, so the
 * OLT never provisioned again. Observed on PON port 2: a healthy O5 with the
 * OMCC up, 59 DS OMCI messages answered, EVERY ONE a Get, and never a MIB-Reset
 * (MT 0x4f), never an Assign_Alloc-ID, never a Create (class 268) -- Match State
 * "Initial", no data GEM, no WAN. A value chosen to be unequal became equal the
 * moment the far end remembered it.
 *
 * ⇒ AND THAT IS WHY THE ADAPTIVE WALK BELOW STAYS. This seed is right for THIS
 * OLT because we read its decision code; the walk is what makes the ONU converge
 * on an OLT whose rule we have NOT read. A derived constant answers the OLT we
 * know; the loop answers the ones we do not. */

 * records the two ways a wrong choice ends: a value that MATCHES makes the OLT
 * skip MIB-Reset and every Create; mds=0 "wedges this OLT in a GET poll loop".
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-08-16, after this board was moved to the OLT's PON port 2: with

 * only a MIB-Reset or an applied Create/Set moves it -- the OLT held Match State
 * "Initial", and the ONU had no data GEM and no WAN while sitting healthy at O5.
 * The seed had become, on that record, the wedging value its own comment warns
 * about.
 *
 * ⇒ SO WE STOP GUESSING AND CLOSE THE LOOP ON THE OUTCOME. We cannot observe
 * lsync, but we can observe the ONE thing that matters: whether the OLT is
 * PROVISIONING us. If it keeps reading and never provisions, the value we report
 * is not doing its job, and we report a different one. That is the whole idea:
 * the ONU adapts to the OLT it is actually attached to, on any port, against any
 * stored value, with nothing to re-tune by hand.
 *
 * THE WALK: +37 each step over the range 1..255. 0 is not a reportable value at
 * all here (it is the value this rig observed wedging the OLT in a Get poll
 * loop), and 37 is coprime with 255, so the walk visits EVERY reportable value
 * before repeating -- an exhaustive search, not a sample. Rate-bounded by the
 * OLT's own audit cadence and NEVER count-capped: a recovery path that gives up
 * is a device that needs a human, which is what this project's robustness bar
 * forbids.
 *
 * ★ THE ARITHMETIC IS MODULO 255, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING -- MEASURED, NOT
 * ASSUMED. This walk was first written as `mds += 37; if (!mds) mds = 1;`, whose
 * comment claimed the same exhaustive search on the strength of 37 being coprime
 * with 256. It is not: folding 0 onto 1 splices the +37 orbit into a CYCLE, and
 * from mds == 1 that cycle is only 83 long (37 * 83 == 255 mod 256), so from the
 * seed the search covered 83 of 255 values -- 32%, silently. Caught by

 * Derived from observing the stock device's OMCI-TX behavior (clean-room: the
 * values below are FACTS; the code is our own). The stock OMCI-TX path
 * builds a zeroed 5-word txInfo on the stack and OR-patches three
 * words, then the NIC-TX layer copies the OMCI PDU into an skb and submits the
 * txInfo, where the ring engine OR-s the descriptor control flags
 * into word0, sets OWN in word2, publishes the ring slot and kicks the per-ring
 * poll doorbell. The descriptor is 5 u32 words at offsets 0/4/8/12/16 = opts1 /
 * addr / opts2 / opts3 / opts4. CONFIRMED from the stock submit path: OWN = bit31 of
 * the word at OFFSET 8 = opts2/word2 (read word at 8, OR in 0x80000000, store back);
 * word0/opts1 (offset 0) carries the org/desc-flag control and is the LAST
 * word copied to the live ring after a sync barrier (a sync, then the store of
 * word0). So OWN lives in opts2 and is set LAST in our build, after the body.
 * Word layout (32-bit words; word0 published last):
 *
 *   word0 (opts1): segment/org control. Stock OR-s 0x02240000 (bits 25/21/18) on
 *                  top of the FS/LS/len that the submit path fills; the submit
 *                  path additionally OR-s the descriptor flags 0xb8800000 |
 *                  0x40000000 and re-OR-s (word0 & 0x077e0000).
 *   word2/word3 = the stock GMAC tx_info (opts2->word2, opts3->word3, copied
 *   VERBATIM onto the ring; the GMAC tx_info bitfields). Stock
 *   OMCI-TX directs the OMCI PDU CPU->PON like this:
 *     word2 (opts2): cputag(bit31) | tx_portmask[26:16] = (1 << ponPort).
 *     word3 (opts3): keep(23) | dislrn(21) | cputag_psel(20) | l34_keep(17) |
 *                    tx_dst_stream_id[6:0] = OMCC SID (=64, a PLAIN 7-bit value,
 *                    NOT one-hot). cputag_psel = PORT-SELECT egress: the switch
 *                    egresses DIRECTLY to the masked port with NO L2 DA lookup,
 *                    bypassing VLAN/PISO/flooding. keep/l34_keep/dislrn stop the
 *                    switch modifying / L3-L4-filtering / SA-learning the frame.
 *                    extspa is NOT set for OMCI.
 *   ⛔ The OLD encoding was FABRICATED and never reached the US-NIC: word2
 *   0x80080000 set bit19, which lands in tx_portmask[26:16] as value 8 = the CPU
 *   port (3) -> the switch bounced the OMCI back to the CPU and flooded it to LAN
 *   (the LAN wedge); word3 used a PON_SID one-hot + ExtSpa with cputag_psel=0 and
 *   stream_id=0, so no port-select and wrong SID. rxsid=0, ustx=0, no egress.
 *   word1, word4: left zero (stock leaves them 0 from the initial memset).

 * ============================================================================
 * OMCI (ITU-T G.988) BASELINE RESPONDER — LUNA'S OWN COPY.  IT DID NOT MOVE.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS, AND WHY IT IS STILL SITTING IN AN ETHERNET DRIVER
 *   Everything from here down to rtl9602c_eth_omci_report_oper_up() is
 *   PROTOCOL, not hardware: the G.988 message types, the managed-entity model,
 *   the dynamic OLT-provisioned ME store, the MIB-Upload row table and the
 *   downstream-request to upstream-response dispatcher.  None of it touches a
 *   register.  It lives in rtl9602c_eth.c only because the US-OMCI transmit
 *   path (the OMCC SID, the TX descriptor steering, the ring) is here and the
 *   responder was written next to its transmitter.  That is a layering
 *   violation, and it is KNOWN — this block is the record of it.
 *
 * WHERE THE COMMON LAYER IS
 *   target/linux/gpon-common/files-6.18/drivers/net/gpon/
 *     gpon_omci_core.{c,h}  the G.988 MESSAGE layer (parse, dispatch, response
 *                           build, trailer + MIC)
 *     gpon_omci_me.{c,h}    the ME MODEL layer (attribute descriptor table,
 *                           board identity, MIB-Upload rows, instance store)
 *   That layer is common because G.988 is a specification, not a chip fact:
 *   the same message rules hold on Luna (MIPS32, big-endian) and on Cortina
 *   (ARM64, little-endian), so exactly ONE copy of them belongs in the tree.
 *   realtek-elnath compiles it today.  realtek-luna does NOT, yet.
 *
 * WHY THIS CODE WAS NOT MOVED — MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED (2026-08-05)
 *   Re-pointing this responder at the common core is NOT code motion: it
 *   changes the octets this ONU puts on the fibre.  Both responders were
 *   compiled on x86 and driven with the SAME 82 downstream PDUs (MIB-Reset,
 *   MIB-Upload, a GET sweep over 18 classes x 3 masks, MIB-Upload-Next across
 *   the row space, Create/Set/Delete including their error paths, the odd
 *   message types, AR-clear, a non-baseline DevID, a runt, a retransmit, and
 *   the autonomous VEIP AVC).  Result: 80 of the 82 responses DIFFER.  The
 *   two that match are the two where both sides correctly emit nothing.
 *
 *   Nine independent causes, each of which ALONE breaks bit-identity:
 *    1. MIC ALGORITHM.  This file computes crc32_le (reflected, zlib) — see
 *       rtl9602c_omci_set_mic() above; the common core computes crc32_be
 *       (AAL5, G.984.4).  Four different bytes at 44..47 on EVERY message,
 *       including every message whose body is identical.  Follow-up F3.
 *       Both firmwares provision against this OLT today and nothing yet
 *       explains that — do not "fix" either side without an on-wire capture.
 *    2. GET VALUE-AREA END.  rtl9602c_omci_get_fill() below fills [11,40) =
 *       29 octets; the common core fills [11,36) = 25 and uses 36..39 for the
 *       G.988 unsupported- and failed-attribute masks.  Follow-up F2.
 *    3. GET RESULT CODE.  This file answers OK unless it overran the buffer;
 *       the common core answers 0x09 ATTR_FAILED whenever the OLT asked for an
 *       attribute the model does not know.  Measured: classes 2, 5, 7, 11,
 *       131 and 262 all flip 0x00 to 0x09.
 *    4. BOARD IDENTITY.  ME 257 attribute 1 reads "HSGQ-X111W" here and
 *       "HSGQ-X400AXF" in the common ME model — a DIFFERENT PRODUCT.  The ME
 *       model layer is per-board data by design, so Luna must supply its own
 *       before it can share the message layer (plan item M5, not done yet).
 *    5. CONFIG-APPLY RESULT CODES.  Create of an existing instance 0x00 to
 *       0x07, Delete of an absent one 0x00 to 0x05, Set of an unmodelled
 *       class 0x00 to 0x04.  This file never NAKs a config message.
 *    6. AR-CLEAR.  With the acknowledgement-request bit clear this file still
 *       transmits a reply; the common core applies the change and stays
 *       silent, which is what G.988 asks for.
 *    7. UNHANDLED MESSAGE TYPE.  This file answers 0x02 NOT_SUPPORTED; the
 *       common core answers 0x00 with empty contents.
 *    8. GET NEXT OPCODE.  OMCI_MT_GET_NEXT is 0x10 just below and 0x1a in the
 *       common header — 0x10 is really the ALARM opcode, so this file answers
 *       a real Get Next through its default arm.  Follow-up F1.  Adopting the
 *       common header is not even a compile-clean no-op: it raises
 *       "OMCI_MT_GET_NEXT redefined" (verified, not predicted).
 *    9. MIB-DATA-SYNC.  This file bumps MDS on every config message; the
 *       common core does not bump it on a rejected one.  After the same
 *       sequence: 46 here against 44 there.
 *
 *   Anyone proposing the move must land F1/F2/F3, give the common ME model
 *   Luna's board data, then re-run that differential — and a green x86
 *   differential still only GATES a boot, it never proves the OLT accepts the
 *   new bytes.  X111W is off the rig, so the change cannot be validated
 *   end-to-end today, and an OMCI responder the OLT silently drops is a
 *   churn-lock: three of this file's own guard comments below were written
 *   after exactly that.

	 *
	 *   [ 7.036] datapath_tables_init done (tbl_ok=1)   <- first open, fine

	 *
	 * Tearing the fabric down under a PON link that has already reached O5
	 * drops it, so the ONU re-ranges -- three full cycles -- and the OLT sees
	 * an ONU that keeps coming and going.  On a live PON that is not merely
	 * slow, it is churn the operator's OLT pays for.
	 *
	 * ⇒ the heavy bring-up runs ONCE.  A later open re-arms the GMAC (rings
	 *   are allocated above, hw_program below) and leaves the fabric and the
	 *   PON link alone -- which is what `ndo_open` is supposed to do.
	 *
	 * ⚠ NOT AN OPTIMISATION OF A CORRECT PATH: the second run was actively
	 *   harmful.  If a future board genuinely needs the fabric rebuilt on a
