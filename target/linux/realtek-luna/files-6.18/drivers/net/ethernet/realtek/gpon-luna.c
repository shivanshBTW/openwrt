/*
 * Realtek RTL9602C GPON MAC — foundation driver.
 *
 * Independent implementation from the SoC's register interface and the
 * G.984/G.988 protocols. The GPON MAC is a sub-block of the "Luna" switch core
 * (SWCORE, phys 0x1B000000); its register window begins at SWCORE + 0x700000
 * (phys 0x1B700000). Register offsets and field positions are hardware facts
 * taken from the SoC register map.
 *
 * This stage brings up the register-access layer, initialises the PON SerDes
 * (whose CMU/PLL provides the MAC core clock — without it the MAC cannot leave
 * reset and the GTC banks read floating), and reports the MAC identity plus the
 * live GPON activation state (the ONU FSM O1..O5, ONU-ID and ranging
 * equalisation delay) via /proc/gpon. The GPON
 * activation FSM (downstream sync, ranging) runs autonomously in hardware once
 * the MAC is out of soft-reset and fed valid downstream GTC; the upstream PLOAM
 * message FSM (serial-number / password / OMCI transport) that drives O3..O5
 * builds on this foundation.
 *
 * The GPON MAC window responds without any extra gating (it shares the SWCORE
 * window the Ethernet driver already maps); GPON_TEST (off 0x14) reads the
 * power-on scratch pattern 0x12345678.

/*
 * rtl8290b_apc_init() — RTL8290B (chip_type==1) B-variant laser APC/OFFK ignition.
 *
 * This is the flow the stock BOSA/laser module runs for the B-variant chip, and the
 * one our clean-room bosa_apc_calibrate (rtl8290 NON-B) gets wrong. The decisive
 * difference is the OFFK (modulator offset) calibration: the B chip completes it
 * via the FSU done-flag (R29/0x31d & 0x3c == 0x3c), NOT via the non-B R30/0x31e
 * b7 poll. Without OFFK the modulator offset is never nulled, so the laser emits
 * DC between bursts, deafening the shared downstream RX -> ~50% lease. This
 * implementation:
 *
 *   - gates on the MCU power-on + CHECK_READY ((0x383&0xe0)==0xc0 AND
 *     (0x301&0x80)!=0) before touching anything;
 *   - writes the W62/W63 OFFK_EN trio in B order (0x24e b7=1; 0x23e=0xfd;
 *     0x23f=0xfd) and the per-board DCL setpoints P0/P1/Pavg = 0x26/0x50/0x50;
 *   - runs both W77 (0x24d) MCU-command handshake batches;
 *   - runs the FSU/OFFK-FSM config + ARM, then POLLS R29(0x31d) to (&0x3c)==0x3c
 *     completion with a bounded timeout + pr_warn on fail (does NOT declare done
 *     on the wrong R30 poll);
 *   - latches on full-done, loads the per-board operating bias/mod LUT;
 *   - keeps EN_L (0x204 b4) BURST-GATED: EN_L=1 only transiently to seat the APC,
 *     then deasserted to 0 (0x204=0x8e) so the laser is NOT CW (DS-safe);
 *   - laser-safety: aborts the ignition window if the monitor photodiode reads no
 *     feedback (MPD==0) or a hard TX-kill fault latches, so we never run the
 *     booster open-loop above the calibrated bias/mod ceiling.
 *
 * Reg numbers are the decimal BOSA register ids; the slave banking (hi-nibble
 * of reg>>8 -> 0x50/0x51/0x54/0x55) is done inside bosa_read_reg/bosa_write_reg.

/*
 * gpon_serdes_init_stock() - stock rev-A GPON SerDes bring-up
 * ORDER as observed from the stock device, with OUR golden analog overlay applied
 * in that order. VERIFIED 2026-06-16 against:
 *   - the stock GPON mode-set sequence (the PON-MAC GPON-mode path and its
 *     inlined ModeV1 analog config sub-step)
 *   - the chip's register map (every offset below confirmed)
 *   - the chip's field map (every lsp/len confirmed)
 *
 * SCOPE NOTE (corrected): this is NOT a bit-faithful replica of stock's ANALOG
 * config. The stock sequence has NO golden table and NO fib_reg0 loop;
 * the ModeV1 analog sub-step IS the entire stock analog config. The golden
 * table + fib power-on here are OUR overlay (same data as gpon_serdes_init),
 * applied in stock ORDER (after the reset). The ModeV1 explicit writes overwrite
 * every overlapping golden entry, so the final operating point is the ModeV1
 * one. What IS faithful to stock is the ORDER (reset-first), the single reset
 * bit (CMD_SDS_RST_PS only, NOT CMD_SDS_CFG_RST_PS), and the D2A/sample-clock
 * bits being SET=1 (the value stock programs; note the LIVE stock ONU reads them
 * clear at O5 - a real programmed-vs-runtime divergence worth A/B testing).
 *
 * __init: this function reads sds_analog_golden[]/fib_reg0_banks[], both
 * __initconst, so it MUST live in .init.text or modpost reports a section
 * mismatch and (post-init) it would read freed memory. Marked __init
 * accordingly. If post-init re-runnability is ever required, de-__initconst
 * both tables (a wider change shared with gpon_serdes_init).
 *
 * Offsets not in the file's #define block are declared local (consistent with
 * the existing 0x22588/0x225a0/etc. literals used elsewhere in this file).

	 * ★ class=range, NOT unknown, and the difference is the whole point of
	 *   the two classes. The DECLARED domain is "exactly one T-CONT -- the
	 *   one we keep -- may hold a live alloc": every other entry is supposed

	 *   resolve the OLT's grant to a T-CONT nothing was draining. That IS a
	 *   finding, and the reader must fail on it rather than file it as
	 *   support work.
	 *
	 * The dump is the entry itself: d[0] = the CAM index that was wrong,
	 * d[1] = the ONE index allowed to hold a live alloc, d[2..3] = the
	 * 12-bit Alloc-ID the wrong entry held, big-endian.  So the line alone
	 * says WHICH entry, WHICH entry it should have been, and WHICH
	 * allocation -- with nothing to correlate against a /proc read taken at
	 * some other moment.  (`keep` rides in the dump rather than in `want`
	 * so that `want` stays a plain literal: the reader parses want= up to
	 * the first space, and a formatted token is one more thing that can

		 * ★★ THE PREVIOUS COMMENT HERE WAS WRONG, AND IT WAS WRONG IN THE
		 *    DIRECTION THAT MATTERED (corrected 2026-08-20, RE'd from the
		 *    vendor SDK's own reader, tier 3, cross-checked against a sibling
		 *    chip's DAL, tier 4, and against G.984.3's allocation structure).
		 *    It said "each captured allocation carries a granted 12-bit
		 *    Alloc-ID" and told the reader to cross it against the CAM's
		 *    alloc.  There IS NO Alloc-ID in the capture.  What word 0 carries
		 *    is a 5-bit T-CONT INDEX — the value AFTER the alloc-CAM has
		 *    already resolved the grant.  So the comparison it asked for could
		 *    never be made, and a grant that MISSED the CAM cannot appear here
		 *    as "an Alloc-ID that does not match" at all.  A misleading name is
		 *    a defect and is renamed the day it is proven wrong.
		 *
		 *    The second error was arithmetic: an allocation is TWO words with
		 *    an 8-byte STRIDE, so the old d[0..5] print showed THREE
		 *    allocations while its own label claimed six.
		 *
		 * WORD 0 (0x2400 + 8*i): [23] VALID  [22] LST  [21] EoB  [20] SoB
		 *                        [19] PLOAMu [18] FEC  [17:16] DBRu
		 *                        [14:12] MF  [4:0] T-CONT index
		 * WORD 1 (0x2400 + 8*i + 4): [15:0] StartTime, [31:16] StopTime.
		 * VALID / T-CONT / StartTime / StopTime are each confirmed by two
		 * independent sources; the SoB/EoB/LST/MF bits rest on one and are not
		 * relied on here.  Status 0x2010 carries exactly one defined bit,
		 * [8] CAP_OVERFL — there is NO done/ready/fresh bit anywhere in this
		 * engine, which is why the old "read /proc twice for a fresh capture"
		 * advice rested on nothing.
		 *
		 * ⚠⚠ THE ARM BELOW IS STILL INCOMPLETE, AND THIS COMMENT SAYS SO
		 *    RATHER THAN LETTING A READER ASSUME OTHERWISE.  The vendor's own
		 *    sequence is: write 0 -> write CAP_CLR(bit14)|CAP_FRAME_NUM ->
		 *    write CAP_EN(bit15)|CAP_FRAME_NUM -> WAIT 5-10 ms (40-80 DS
		 *    frames) -> read CAP_OVERFL -> read the data.  Ours ORs CAP_EN into
		 *    whatever was there: no CAP_CLR pulse, no frame count, no settle,
		 *    and no fresh arming edge if CAP_EN was already set.  It is left
		 *    exactly as it was on purpose — completing it means new register
		 *    writes and a sleep in this path, and there is no board on the
		 *    bench to prove them on.  ⇒ EVERY report below is gated on the
		 *    per-entry VALID bit, which is the only freshness signal this
		 *    silicon offers, and an all-zero (never-armed) buffer therefore
		 *    reports NOTHING rather than reporting T-CONT 0 thirty-two times.
		 *
		 * ★ WHAT THE REPORT MEANS.  `tcont_en` is the set of T-CONTs the US
		 *   scheduler was actually configured for.  A VALID captured
		 *   allocation naming a T-CONT outside that set is a grant this ONU is
		 *   answering on a queue nothing drains — which is the alloc-CAM wall
		 *   seen from the other end, and it is class=range, a finding.  The
		 *   CAM-side witness in gpon_alloc_cam_clear_others() sees the same
		 *   fault EARLIER, while it can still be prevented; this one confirms

 * ★★ THIS FSM ALSO EXISTS, VERBATIM, IN THE SHARED TREE — AND THAT IS
 *    DELIBERATE, NOT A LEFTOVER. DO NOT DELETE EITHER COPY. (2026-08-05)
 *
 * The whole block below (the PLOAM message types, the serial-number parse, the
 * upstream builders, the burst-overhead and equalization-delay computations,
 * the state transitions, the downstream dispatch and the poll decisions) was
 * carved into the hardware-decoupled common core at
 *
 *     target/linux/gpon-common/files-6.18/drivers/net/gpon/gpon_ploam.{h,c}
 *
 * which BOTH OpenWrt targets pull in through `FILES_DIR +=`, and which also
 * compiles on x86 so the activation FSM can be driven by an adversarial OLT
 * under libFuzzer+ASan+UBSan with no board in the loop — this project's PRIMARY
 * correctness gate. That, plus the roadmap (the future ARM OLT and other ONU
 * brands need this same engine), is why the layer is common. Measured honestly:
 * it does NOT de-duplicate anything today, because Elnath has no software PLOAM
 * FSM at all — its MAC runs O1->O5 and auto-ACKs in silicon.
 *
 * ★ THE CODE BELOW IS STILL THE ONE THAT RUNS. The shared copy is not yet
 * wired: this driver has not been converted to call it, so the two are live
 * original and offline reference respectively. Keep them in step — a fix here
 * that is not mirrored there makes the offline gate lie about this driver.
 *
 * ★ WHY THE REWIRE DID NOT LAND WITH THE CARVE -- AND WHAT IS LEFT OF THAT.
 * Four obstacles were MEASURED 2026-08-05.  ALL FOUR ARE NOW GONE (2026-08-28);
 * the list is kept because each says what a future obstacle of the same kind
 * looks like, and because "we already checked" is worth nothing without dates.
 *
 *   1. ★ RESOLVED 2026-08-28. The core kept the two computations this driver
 *      needs at __init -- set_eqd() and apply_boh() -- `static`, reachable only
 *      from gpon_ploam_ds(), so a shell could not call them. The core now
 *      exposes gpon_ploam_set_eqd() and gpon_ploam_apply_boh(): the SAME
 *      functions behind thin wrappers, deliberately not copies, because
 *      re-implementing the arithmetic here is exactly how gpon_proto.c drifted.
 *   2. ★ RESOLVED. gpon_ploam.o was `# gpon-pending` in the shared Makefile;
 *      it is `obj-y` now, so the gpon_ploam_* symbols exist at link time.
 *   3. ★ RESOLVED 2026-08-20. This directory's Makefile carries
 *      `ccflags-y += -I$(srctree)/drivers/net/gpon`, so a shared-tree header
 *      resolves from here.
 *   4. ★ RESOLVED 2026-08-28, and the diagnosis had the wrong file. The claim
 *      was that adopting "the core's parse" would change this ONU's identity
 *      for a malformed onu_sn=. What it actually described was
 *      gpon_ploam_parse_sn(), a SECOND decoder inside the core that disagreed
 *      with gpon_sn.c's -- 0xf for a bad nibble where the strict parser
 *      refuses. It had zero callers and is now a wrapper over the strict one,
 *      so the core has ONE decoder and this driver is already rebased onto it.
 *      The behaviour change was made deliberately, with a pr_warn, and it fixes
 *      a spurious re-range: a malformed string used to manufacture a different
 *      serial and read as an identity change.
 *
 * ⇒ WHAT REMAINS IS NOT AN OBSTACLE, IT IS THE WORK: the FSM below is
 * global-based over ~11 file-scope variables while the core is object-based
 * (struct gpon_ploam). That is a shape change, it must land and be gated on its
 * own, and it is now the ONLY thing between this driver and the common FSM.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT IS NOT BOARD-VERIFIABLE ON DEMAND: a green offline gate GATES a
 * boot, it never proves the hardware works, so the shape change lands behind
 * the offline differential first and is confirmed on the board after.

 * ★★★ THIS FSM IS THE DUPLICATE. DO NOT EXTEND IT (2026-08-27).

 * drivers/net/gpon/gpon_ploam.c is the common G.984.3 activation FSM: same
 * O1..O7 states, the same message set, and it is HW-decoupled and fuzzed on
 * x86 with time as an explicit input. As of today it is BUILT by every target,
 * so it can no longer rot unnoticed -- which is what let this second copy go on
 * being the living one.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY IT IS STILL HERE, stated so nobody reads the delay as approval: the
 * X400AXF is the only board that boots, and it does activation IN SILICON --
 * it never calls a software PLOAM FSM. So swapping this shell onto the common
 * file can be proven by the offline suite and by nothing at all on hardware,
 * on a board that currently wedges at ~30 s. The bar this project sets for a
 * change is an end-to-end witness, and there is none available for this one
 * yet.
 *
 * ⇒ A FIX THAT BELONGS TO THE PROTOCOL GOES IN THE COMMON FILE AND IS MIRRORED
 *   HERE, never the other way round. Anything else widens the gap that has to
 *   be closed later, and this tree has already paid for that twice today: an
 *   OMCI responder that had drifted into a weaker copy, and two decoders of one
 *   serial number that disagreed about what a serial number is.
 */
/*
 * ===== The core PLOAM shell: this driver, expressed as struct gpon_ploam_ops =====
 *
 * ★★ INSTALLED AND SWITCHABLE, BEHIND `core_fsm` (default 0).
 * gpon_ploam_init() IS called with these ops (see the probe), and
 * gpon_ploam_ds() dispatches through the core when the parameter is set; with
 * it clear the FSM below runs byte for byte as before.  This is the A/B, not a
 * design note.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS COMMENT SAID "NOT INSTALLED YET.  Nothing calls gpon_ploam_init() with
 * these ops" UNTIL 2026-08-28, and by then the init call had been there for a
 * while.  A stale comment that says the core is unwired is worse than none: it
 * tells the next reader there is no A/B to run, which is the whole state of
 * this migration.
 *
 * What the ops table bought before it was switched on is still worth stating:
 * the COMPILER checks that every callback the core demands can actually be
 * expressed from this driver's existing primitives, with the right types,
 * before a single line of the FSM moves.  A shim of stubs would prove nothing,
 * so every op either does the real work or is left NULL with the reason.
 *
 * ★ WHY THE SIGNATURES DIFFER WHERE THEY DO.  The core owns the ARITHMETIC and
 * the shell owns the REGISTER.  gpon_set_eqd() here computes eqd1 from
 * MIN_DELAY1 and then writes; the core splits that into get_min_delay() +
 * set_eqd(multiframe, intraframe).  The two arithmetics were compared line by
 * line on 2026-08-28 and are identical -- value + min_delay1*128, divided by
 * the upstream frame length -- which is two independent expressions of one
 * fact agreeing, not one copied from the other.

			 *
			 * RE-RANGE PATH BUGFIX (2026-06-22): on a LOS/deactivate re-range, the OLT
			 * does NOT re-send Assign_Alloc-ID — it assumes the HW CAM binding
			 * persists. The HW CAM IS persistent across the FSM reset (only SW flags
			 * like `gpon_tcont_installed` are cleared). So on re-range, this handler
			 * used to write `alloc = gpon_fsm_onu_id` (e.g. 0) back into the HW CAM,
			 * OVERWRITING the previously-bound 0x100. Result: T-CONT 16 is now bound
			 * to alloc=0, the OLT grants T-CONT 16 on alloc=0 (which it does NOT
			 * grant, since the real alloc is 0x100), `bwm_acpt=0`, `gemus64=0`,
			 * `idle16` climbs, and after ~100s the OLT DEACTs (LOAi timeout).
			 *
			 * Fix: if we have a previously-known OMCC alloc (from a successful prior
			 * activation — `gpon_omcc_alloc != 0` survives DEACT/LOS handlers since
			 * only `gpon_tcont_installed` is cleared there) and the T-CONT install
			 * guard is NOT set (re-range case), use the known OMCC alloc. Otherwise
			 * (first boot: gpon_omcc_alloc == 0, gpon_tcont_installed == false) use the
			 * placeholder gpon_fsm_onu_id (= alloc 0, which the OLT grants on the
			 * first activation pass). The Assign_Alloc-ID handler at line ~5294 then
			 * captures the real alloc into gpon_omcc_alloc for subsequent re-ranges. */
