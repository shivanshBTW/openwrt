/*
 * Realtek "Luna" SoC watchdog timer (RTL960x family).
 *
 * The block is three 32-bit registers sitting at the top of the SoC timer/
 * counter (TC) block, at TC_BASE + 0x60 -- physically 0x18003260 on every Luna
 * part looked at so far, including the RTL9602C "Europa" this target ships on.
 * It is a TWO-PHASE watchdog:
 *
 *	phase 1 expires  -> the block raises its own timeout interrupt, so a
 *			    vendor kernel can dump state while still running;
 *	phase 2 expires  -> the SoC is RESET, in the mode selected by
 *			    WDT_RESET_MODE.
 *
 * Both phases restart together when the counter is kicked, so the time from the
 * last kick to the reset is (PH1 + 1 + PH2 + 1) ticks, and one tick is
 * 2^(25 + WDT_CLK_SC) cycles of the LX peripheral bus clock.  At the 200 MHz LX
 * clock this SoC runs, the coarsest scale gives a 1.342 s tick and a 42 s
 * ceiling; the finest gives 168 ms.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHERE THESE FACTS COME FROM, and how far each one is actually proven.  The
 * question "does this silicon even HAVE a watchdog" was open when this driver
 * was written, so the answer is recorded rather than assumed.
 *
 *  [1] LIVE, ON THIS SoC.  arch/mips/realtek-luna/setup.c has driven exactly
 *      these registers since bring-up: luna_machine_restart() writes WDT_CTRL
 *      at 0x18003268 with enable | scale 0 | PH1 = 1 and does NOT kick, and
 *      that is how this port reboots.  It works, which proves the block exists
 *      at that address, that WDT_E arms it, that the timeout really resets the
 *      chip, and that RESET_MODE 0 re-enters the boot ROM.
 *  [2] THIS BOARD'S OWN STOCK FIRMWARE.  The X111W vendor kernel image contains
 *      the string "arch/mips/bsp_rtl8686/luna_watchdog.c" together with
 *      "WDT_E=%d", "WDT_CLK_SC=%d", "PH1_TO=%d", "PH2_TO=%d",
 *      "WDT_RESET_MODE=%d" and "[BSP_WDT_PH1TO_IRQ #%d]", and its rootfs arms
 *      the thing on every boot -- /etc/init.d/rc34 does
 *      `echo 1 > /proc/luna_watchdog/watchdog_flag`.  The shipped product runs
 *      with this watchdog enabled.
 *  [3] THE FAMILY'S OWN BSP HEADERS.  TC_BASE 0xB8003200, the +0x60/+0x64/+0x68
 *      register triple, WDT_E and the kick at bit 31, and the 22/15/29 field
 *      shifts are declared once for the whole Luna family and are NOT
 *      chip-conditional, in a tree whose build variants include this chip.
 *
 *      *** CITATION CORRECTED 2026-08-26. ***  This paragraph used to add that
 *      the scale encoding "is named there too", i.e. in the BSP HEADERS.  It is
 *      NOT: bspchip.h declares only WDT_E, WDT_KICK, the 31 mask and the three
 *      shifts.  An audit that grepped the headers therefore reported the
 *      encoding as UNSOURCED and cast doubt on every window figure this driver
 *      has ever published.  THE CONSTANT WAS RIGHT AND THE CITATION WAS WRONG.
 *      The encoding is declared in a KCONFIG HELP TEXT, which is why a header
 *      grep missed it:
 *
 *        arch/mips/rtl9607c/Kconfig.hook:60-66
 *          config WDT_CLK_SC ... help: 0:2^25, 1:2^26, 2:2^27, 3:2^28
 *
 *      present in BOTH on-disk vendor copies, and corroborated twice more:
 *      vendor U-Boot swp_bootm_error_handler.c:24-30 tabulates ph1_to -> seconds
 *      as exactly (n+1) x 1.34 s (which also proves the field counts from ONE),
 *      and the vendor's own rtl819x_wdt.c for this block declares
 *      max_timeout = 43 with the comment "for LX bus 200MHz, time tick 1.34 s".
 *      That ceiling is a NUMERIC SIEVE no comment can fake: a 5-bit PH1 field is
 *      32 ticks, and 32 ticks = 43 s ONLY at base 2^25 (2^24 -> 21.5 s,
 *      2^26 -> 85.9 s).  Tier 3, from >= 2 independent sources.
 *
 *      The reset modes (0 = full chip, 1 = CPU + IPSec, 2 = software) ARE named
 *      in the BSP headers, as this paragraph said.
 *  [4] A LIVE READ ON A SIBLING PART.  A boot log from the RTL9607C reference
 *      board prints the three registers by address -- 0xb8003260, 0xb8003264,
 *      0xb8003268 -- with WDT_CTRL holding 0xe7c00000, which decodes under the
 *      layout below as scale 3, PH1 31, PH2 0, reset mode 0.  Every field lands
 *      where this file says it does.
 *
 * The one thing NOT established is the meaning of the middle register
 * (+0x04, the vendor calls it WDTINTRR).  Nothing here reads or writes it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ARMED IS NOT FIRED, AND THIS DRIVER REFUSES TO PRETEND OTHERWISE.
 *
 * There is no established latch on this SoC that says "the last reset was mine".
 * WDT_E reads 1 whenever the watchdog is ENABLED, which on a healthy unit is all
 * the time -- so a witness built on it would report a bite after every power cut
 * and every clean reboot.  That is the exact phantom this project already
 * installed once on its other board, where a vendor breadcrumb reading 3 meant
 * "the watchdog was started" and was nearly published as "the watchdog fired".
 *
 * The X111W stock firmware has no reset-reason node at all (searched: no
 * reboot_reason / reset_reason / reset_cause anywhere in its kernel or rootfs),
 * so there is nothing to adopt either.
 *
 * => this driver advertises NO WDIOF_CARDRESET and never populates
 *    wdd.bootstatus.  The witness that the watchdog BIT is the one the test
 *    suite already mandates for every case: /proc/uptime went BACKWARDS while
 *    nothing asked for a reboot.  If a real latch is ever established here, it
 *    belongs in bootstatus and this paragraph should be deleted, not softened.

	 * zero resets past 34 s), and an instrumented kick then showed why:
	 *
	 *   rtl960x-wdt: kick cnt=0x00000000 -> 0x00000000 ctrl=0xe5800000
	 *   ... 54 of them, one every 5 s (procd's cadence) ... and it still bit.

	 * documented "bit 31 = kick" is not sufficient on its own.
	 *
	 * ⇒ reload the way the block demonstrably accepts: rewrite WDT_CTRL with
	 *   the enable bit, which is exactly what start() does and what arms the
	 *   counter in the first place.  start() is a read-modify-write that
	 *   touches only the decoded fields, so this changes no unknown bit --
	 *   the reasoning above luna_wdt_kick() about the undecoded 31 bits of
	 *   WDT_CNT stands untouched, and the kick stays where it is inside
	 *   start().

	 * in a 30.1-32.1 s band, whatever the software timeout said.  The counter
	 * was simply never reloaded since it was armed.
	 *
	 * ⚠ THE DISABLED WINDOW IS REAL AND IT IS THE POINT: between stop() and
	 * start() the watchdog is off for a few register writes.  That is what a
