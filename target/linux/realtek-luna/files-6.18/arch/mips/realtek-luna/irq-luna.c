 * Realtek RTL960x "Luna" SoC interrupt controller (the "GISR" aggregator).
 *
 * ONE driver, two chips, a table for what differs.  It replaces
 * irq-rtl9602c.c and irq-rtl9603cvd.c, which were 96-98%% identical: the same
 * struct, the same mask/unmask/map/dispatch/of_init, the same offsets, and two
 * spellings of every name (`LUNA_INTC_GIMR` and `GISR_GIMR`, same value).  What
 * actually differed was three things, and all three are now DATA: the routing
 * table, whether a second CPU block must be masked, and nothing else.
 *
 * ★ THE MERGE WAS DEFERRED ON PURPOSE, AND THE DEFERRAL'S OWN TERMS ARE MET.
 * irq-rtl9603cvd.c said: *"kept apart deliberately for now -- that driver
 * carries two routing overrides established empirically on the X111W, which are
 * facts about THAT board's cascade and must not be inherited here.  Merge them
 * into one luna_* driver once this chip has booted and both routings are
 * proven."*  Both halves were checked before merging rather than assumed:
 *   - the per-board routing is NOT inherited: each chip keeps its own `irr[]`,
 *     which is the whole point of the table;
 *   - the RTL9602C's routing is proven by the X111W booting on it;
 *   - the RTL9603CVD's is proven by the G24W's console log of 2026-08-23,
 *     which shows `Linux version 6.18.31` and an INTERACTIVE `root@OpenWrt:~#`
 *     shell at uptime 1:50 answering commands.  That is this file's own stated
 *     test: without this aggregator delivering the UART interrupt, "early
 *     printk would work and the console would never become interactive".
 *
 * Clean-room: written from observed hardware facts only -- register bases and
 * offsets, bit semantics, the routing scheme and the vendor's own init values.
 * No proprietary source text or structure was copied.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS FAMILY DOES NOT USE A MIPS GIC
 *
 * The RTL9603CVD has NO MIPS GIC and no Coherence Manager.  Its own vendor
 * kernel says so on this exact board (tier 1, LANLY G24W boot console, captured
 * 2026-08-18):
 *
 *	MIPS CPS SMP unable to proceed without a CM
 *	GIC isn't present!
 *	rtl9603cvd_gisr_init: gisr_translate_d2c = ...
 *
 * so a "mti,gic" node here describes silicon that is not present: the UART
 * interrupt would never arrive, early printk would work and the console would
 * never become interactive.  Describe this aggregator instead.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * REGISTER MAP (one block PER CPU where the chip has more than one; stride is
 * a table field, 0 where there is only one block to arrange):
 *
 *	GIMR0	+0x00	mask,   inputs  0..31  (1 = enabled)
 *	GIMR1	+0x04	mask,   inputs 32..63
 *	GISR0	+0x08	status, inputs  0..31  (raw; AND with mask for pending)
 *	GISR1	+0x0c	status, inputs 32..63
 *	IRR0..6	+0x10..	routing, 4 bits per input, 8 inputs per word
 *
 * GIMR0 bit 12 is not an input: it is the master peripheral-IRQ enable and must
 * be set for any peripheral interrupt to be delivered at all.  The dispatch
 * below therefore excludes it from the pending scan.
 *
 * Realtek numbers the routing nibbles in inverted word order: input 0 lives in
 * the *last* IRR word's lowest nibble.
 *
 * ROUTING NIBBLE -> CP0 LINE.  A nibble of 0 disconnects the input; a value V
 * selects aggregator output line V-1, and output line 0 is wired to CP0 HW IRQ
 * 2, so the delivered line is CP0 HW IRQ (V + 1).  Cross-checked two ways, and
 * the two agree on every case:
 *
 *   - the vendor's own dispatchers read GISR word 0 from CP0 IP3 and GISR word
 *     1 from CP0 IP4, and take the SoC timer on IP7;
 *   - the vendor's own routing values (the tables below) give nibble 2 to every
 *     input in word 0 that it uses (switch core, GMAC0, PON NIC), nibble 3 to
 *     every input in word 1 that it uses (UART0, GPIO bank ABCD), and nibble 6
 *     to the per-CPU system timer.
 *
 *   2 -> CP0 IRQ 3	3 -> CP0 IRQ 4		6 -> CP0 IRQ 7
 *
 * The strongest single check is the per-CPU one: the vendor loads a DIFFERENT
 * word 4 on each CPU, and the only nibbles that differ are the two system-timer
 * inputs -- TC0 enabled on CPU0 and disconnected on CPU1, TC1 the other way
 * round.  That is exactly what a per-CPU clockevent needs and nothing else in
 * the map would explain it.
 *
 * INPUT NUMBERING IS THE NATIVE GISR BIT, and it is SHARED BY BOTH CHIPS --
 * which is the strongest evidence that this really is one block: the RTL9602C's
 * device tree in this same target independently uses 49 for UART0 and 43 for
 * the system timer, the same numbers the RTL9603CVD's vendor kernel uses.
 * Named inputs (a reserved input is omitted):
 *
 *	 4 ECC		 5 NAND		 8 switch core	14 USB host p2
 *	16 PCIe		17 PCM0		18 PCM1		24 PON NIC
 *	25 PON NIC DS	26 GMAC0 int0	27 GMAC0 int1	28 VoIP XSI
 *	29 VoIP SPI	31 LX bus debug	32 GPIO JKMN	39 WDT phase-1
 *	40 WDT phase-2	41 GPIO EFGH	42 GPIO ABCD	43..48 TC0..TC5
 *	49..52 UART0..3	60..62 TC6..TC8
 *
 * DELIVERY INVARIANT: every GISR interrupt is delivered to CPU 0.  Only CPU 0's
 * block carries routing and mask bits; a second CPU's block, where the chip has
 * one, is masked shut, so a secondary CPU can never take an interrupt this
 * driver did not arrange.  Per-CPU affinity is OWED work and needs a running
 * SMP kernel to verify, which this family cannot have until the CPS/CM question
 * is settled.
