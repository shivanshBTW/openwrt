  # that would not fit k0 fails the BUILD instead of being discovered on the

  # Device/Default leaves IMAGES empty, so this builds the initramfs uImage only
  # -- no flashable artifact is produced for a SINGLE-BANK board whose only k0
  # holds the stock ORACLE. Do not "fix" that.
  #
  # ★★★ THE PACKAGE SET IS DECLARED HERE, NOT IN A .config (2026-08-27).
  #
  # MEASURED: this device declared NO DEVICE_PACKAGES at all, so the built image
  # carried exactly ONE kmod (kmod-gpio-button-hotplug) against the X111W's 18,
  # and the 17 absent ones are the netfilter and PPP stacks -- i.e. NAT, the
  # firewall and PPPoE could not work here, each surfacing as its own
  # unrelated-looking test failure rather than as one cause.
  #
  # An earlier sitting reached for `.config` instead (dnsmasq, odhcpd-ipv6only,
  # wpad-basic-mbedtls, hostapd-common were selected there by hand). That works
  # for one build and leaves nothing behind: a `.config` is a session artifact,
  # while DEVICE_PACKAGES is the record every future build of this device reads.
  # The list is the X111W's own, minus the luci/gpon-provision half that depends
  # on drivers this board does not have yet, plus hostapd-common.
  #
  # ⚠ wpad-basic-mbedtls and hostapd-common ship the AP daemons; they do NOT
  # give this board a radio. There is no 802.11 PHY here at all -- CONFIG_PCI is
  # OFF in this subtarget's kernel config, so no PCI bus exists, no PCIe host
  # driver for this SoC exists, and no DT node declares one. That is three
  # stacked gaps, and none of them is a package.
  # (2026-08-27: all three closed -- CONFIG_PCI=y, pcie-luna.c, phy0 up.)
  #
  # ★★★ wifi-scripts IS the AP bring-up, and it was MISSING (2026-08-27).
  # MEASURED on this board with phy0 registered and hostapd running: hostapd's
  # ucode glue died with `Unable to resolve path for module 'common'` (that
  # module is /usr/share/ucode/wifi/common.uc, shipped by wifi-scripts along
  # with /lib/netifd/wireless/mac80211.sh), netifd said `Wireless module not
  # found`, network.wireless never existed, and wlan0 stayed `type managed`,
  # DOWN, 0 dBm -- no beacon, wifi_ap_onair FAIL after the full 180 s wait.
  # The X111W's working AP rests on CONFIG_PACKAGE_wifi-scripts=y selected BY
  # HAND in its build tree's .config -- a session artifact this device list
  # (copied from the X111W's DECLARED list) never contained. Same trap as
  # firewall4 above: the .config also carried the explicit deselection lines,
  # which `make defconfig` preserves; they were removed with it.
  #
  # ★ wireless-regdb: same story -- =y by hand in the X111W's .config, absent
  # here; without it cfg80211 logs `regulatory.db is malformed or signature is
  # missing/invalid` and country BO cannot be applied (the suite's regdomain
  # rules read from the official regdb, never hand-written).
  #
  # ★ gpon-provision: ALREADY in this image via .config =y (another session
  # artifact) and RUNNING -- it is the mechanism that applies this unit's own
  # MAC from the factory config partition (rtk_factory reads ELAN_MAC_ADDR out
  # of the Realtek MIB container on this product). Declared here so the record
  # matches the image.
