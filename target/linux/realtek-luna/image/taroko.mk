  #   firewall4(+nft)   - lan/wan zones, lan->wan forward + masquerade (NAT)
  #   odhcpd-ipv6only   - LAN IPv6 RA/DHCPv6 server (distributes the WAN PD)
  #   odhcp6c           - WAN DHCPv6 client (PD request toward the OLT)
  #   ppp ppp-mod-pppoe - PPPoE WAN client (alternative WAN proto to IPoE/DHCP)
  #   wpad-basic-mbedtls - WiFi AP/STA daemon (hostapd+wpa_supplicant) for the
  #     rtl8192fe AP: WPA2-PSK(psk2) + WPA3-SAE personal, no enterprise/EAP, no
  #     mesh; mbedtls TLS (libmbedtls is already pulled by libustream-mbedtls, so
  #     this adds only the ~1MB wpad binary, ~350k squashfs-compressed). This is
  #     the smallest wpad variant that still does psk2 AP + PMF; wpad-mini lacks
  #     SAE/802.11w. Listed here so 'make defconfig' keeps it tied to the device

  #  burned ~60s of boot CPU on this core for nothing - crng seeds itself.)
