 * Cortina-Access NI Ethernet driver for the Realtek RTL9607F "Elnath" -
 * M2c RX datapath: L3QM CPU-EPP descriptor ring + empty-buffer pool + NAPI,
 * making port-0 ingress reach eth0 so ping is bidirectional.
 *
 * Register offsets, bit semantics, descriptor format and init order are
 * hardware facts recovered from the shipped RTL9607F firmware (ca-ne.ko:
 * aal_l3qm_init_cpu_epp, aal_l3qm_init_empty_buffer, aal_l3qm_init_voq,
 * aal_l3qm_enable_rx, aal_l3qm_check_cpu_push_ready,

 * ca_ni_fill_empty_buffer_by_rule_zero, ca_ni_rx_napi,
 * ca_ni_rx_napi_get_header_from_64bit_epp, ca_ni_rx_interrupt,
 * aal_l3qm_enable_cpu_epp_interrupt, aal_ni_port_rx_ctrl_set,
 * aal_ple_dft_fwd_set) and cross-checked against the CA8277B public register
 * bit-field definitions (identical fields, some blocks re-based on the 07f,
 * e.g. the per-EQ config 0x61b8 -> 0x6248).
 *
 * RX model: the driver seeds the CPU empty-buffer pools (EQ id 13 primary +
 * EQ id 14 secondary) with DMA-mapped skb data buffers.  For every ingress
 * frame steered to CPU port 0 the HW
 * picks a pool buffer, writes [64B headroom | 8B HEADER_A | (8B HEADER_CPU) |
 * frame] into it and appends one 8-byte descriptor to a 128-entry FIFO ring
 * in coherent DDR, advancing a byte-granular write pointer.  The level
 * interrupt (GIC SPI 0x54 for CPU port 0) fires on FIFO occupancy; NAPI
 * drains descriptors, recovers the skb via a driver-side PA->skb map (the
 * vendor stashes a backpointer inside the buffer; a map avoids the
 * cache-maintenance trap of writing into a FROM_DEVICE-mapped buffer),
 * refills the pool one-for-one and publishes the new read pointer.
 *
 * Frame steering: the FULL FORWARDING-ENGINE path, matching stock's golden
 * working-RX config (devmem-verified).  An ingress frame is looked up by the
 * L2FE and, being an FDB miss, default-forwarded (DLF) to CPU port 0; the
 * L3FE demux map routes that FE output into the CPU-EPP ring.  (The earlier
 * FE-bypass RX_CNTRL byp_dpid shortcut was abandoned: it left hw wptr stuck
 * at 0 on ~half the boots - non-deterministic.  See cortina_ni_rx_steer_init.)

 *     (ca_ni_rx_napi_get_header +0xc8, ca_ni_rx_napi_get_header_from_64bit_epp
 *     +0xa0), so no SOP means no header;
 *   - the continuation reader (ca_ni_rx_napi_read_epp_64bit_mode) contains no
 *     header parse at all - it invalidates buf+0x40 for 1600 bytes and returns;
 *   - the pointer arithmetic differs decisively between the two cases: the first
 *     buffer's payload is buf + 0x40 + K with K the 8- or 16-byte header block,

 * These belong beside the other pool addresses in cortina-ni-regs.h and are

 * please move them when convenient; nothing else references them.
 *
 * WHY a second pool exists at all.  Two consumers reach the CPU through the QM:
 * the DIRECT punt and the DEEP-QUEUE punt (dest ports 8..15, deep_q=1).  Our
 * config collapsed both onto EQ5/EQ6.
 *
 * ★ The mechanism of that collapse, stated correctly: DEST_PORT_EQ_CFG.prof_sel
 * is CA_NI_QM_DEST_PORT_PROF_SEL = GENMASK(3, 0), a FOUR-bit field at bit 0
 * that indexes EQ_PROFILE DIRECTLY (0..15) - it is NOT a 3-bit field, and there
 * is no masking.  So the deep-queue dest ports, programmed 0x0D, select
 * EQ_PROFILE(13), and profile 13 is written with {EQ5, EQ6}.  Evidence, three
 * ways that agree: the field definition; the live readback prof13(0x615c) =
 * 0x00000065 = {eqp0=5, eqp1=6} alongside destp8 = destp15 = 0x0D; and stock's
 * own pairing destp8 = 0x0C with prof12 = 0xEC = {EQ12, EQ14}, which is the
 * documented deep-queue pool pair and only lines up under direct indexing.
 * (A "3-bit, so 0x0D & 7 = profile 5" reading elsewhere in this file reaches
 * the same pool by accident, because the 0..7 loop happens to fill profile 5
 * with {EQ5, EQ6} too.  It is wrong, and it made a coincidence look like a
 * derivation.)  Stock keeps the two consumers SEPARATE: prof12 = {EQ12, EQ14},
 * prof13 = {EQ13, EQ14}.
 *
 * That collapse is fine while both pools are hardware-managed, and fatal once
 * they are not: this chip's deep-queue enqueue CANNOT consume a CPU-pushed
 * buffer - it needs a self-populated DRAM one (A/B-proven earlier on EQ12, see
 * CA_NI_QM_EQ12_CFG2).  BOARD-MEASURED 2026-07-28: with EQ5/EQ6 flipped to
 * cpu_eq=1, NO downstream frame of any kind reached the driver (not data, not
 * OMCI control; 30-frame DS tap silent, zero OMCI cfg messages) while the LAN
 * path and the fragment ladder were perfect - and 40 samples of rmu0_rx_hdr
 * taken on the WORKING image with no LAN traffic in flight showed DS producing
 * deep_q=1 admissions in 17 of 40.  So the deep queue lost its only DRAM-backed
 * pool.  Giving it its own hardware-managed pool is what lets the direct punt
 * be software-owned.

/* ★★ 2026-07-15 STOCK GOLDEN (STOCK_cpurx_dynamic_golden.txt): the CPU pools are
 * cpu_eq=0 SELF-POPULATING - the QM hardware maps bid n -> CFG0.phy_addr_start +
 * n * CFG2.buffer_size and recycles the bid when NAPI advances the CPU-EPP read
 * pointer.  Stock NEVER software-pushes an RX buffer (CPU_PUSH_PADDR0 0x63cc = 0
 * since boot); the former cpu_eq=1 host-fed push machinery here (cortina_ni_rx_
 * push/seed_pool/populate) was UNVALIDATED HW territory on this silicon and left
 * every admitted frame DMA'd to a bid whose PA never matched our pushed skbs
 * (inactive climbed +1/frame, NAPI read 0xdeadbeef poison).  We back both pools
 * with the reserved DRAM region (rx->cpu_dram) and run copy-break: NAPI copies
 * each delivered frame out of its pool buffer into a fresh skb; the buffer
 * returns to the pool by the EPP-rdptr advance alone - no push path exists.
 *
 * ★★ 2026-07-27 THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE IS WRONG AND IS KEPT ONLY AS A WARNING.
 * "Stock NEVER software-pushes" was concluded from reading CPU_PUSH_PADDR - a
 * WRITE-ONLY doorbell - and finding zero.  A write-only register reads zero on
 * a working system too, so that observation carried no information at all.  The
 * vendor does push: aal_l3qm_set_cpu_push_paddr writes {pa[31:7]<<7 | eqid} to
 * 0x63cc + cpu_port*8, batched once per NAPI poll.
 *
 * The cost of believing it was the IPv4 fragment defect.  With cpu_eq=0 the QM
 * frees the bid at descriptor writeback, so the CPU never owns the buffer: a
 * second frame arriving before NAPI drains lands on the SAME bid.  Measured
 * directly - every frame at pa=09400800, fragment 1's descriptor (dlen=1530)
 * resolving to a buffer already holding fragment 2 (hdra_pkt_size=570), two
 * byte-identical copies of fragment 2 with one IP id => IPFRAG_DUP => the
 * datagram never completes.  Longer bursts instead show the buffer changing
 * under the copy, which completes reassembly with a payload that fails its
 * checksum.  The vendor image reassembles every one on this same silicon.
 *
 * cpu_eq=1 removes the window rather than narrowing it: the QM cannot reclaim a
 * buffer until we re-push it, which happens after skb_put_data.  The earlier
 * attempt failed because it pushed dynamically allocated skb addresses, which
 * lie outside the NE's DDR window; we push PAs from the same reserved region
 * the RMU is provably writing to now.  Selectable: cpu_pool_push=0 restores the
 * self-populating behaviour described above, defect included. */

 *
 * ★★ MASKING MUST LEAVE bits[15:8] SET - they are the descriptor WRITEBACK
 * ENGINE enable, not part of the mask (fixed 2026-08-08; see the register
 * header).  This used to write 0, i.e. it turned the writeback engine OFF on

/*
 * ★★ UPSTREAM QUEUE DEPTH - the L2TM deep-queue per-VoQ admission thresholds.
 *
 * There are TWO different things at 0x2d.. / 0x2e.. that both hold 0x7fff7fff, and
 * confusing them costs a wrong "we diverge from stock" reading:
 *
 *  (1) the DIRECT registers in cortina_ni_deepq_cb_cfg[] - 0x2d80/0x2d88/0x2d8c/
 *      0x2d90/0x2d94/0x2d98 and 0x2ec8..0x2ee8.  These are tier-1 stock live golden
 *      (dev/x400axf/stock/stock_dqsch_2d00.txt, devmem on stock 2026-07-12): stock
 *      itself reads 0x7FFF7FFF there.  We MATCH stock at every one of them - they
 *      are NOT a divergence and are deliberately NOT touched by the knob below.
 *
 *  (2) the two INDEXED per-VoQ threshold profile tables, written through the
 *      two-phase ACCESS/DATA protocol:
 *        DQSCH VOQ  ACCESS 0x2e70 / DATA  0x2e74   - stock residual 0x00700070
 *                                                    (lo = hi = 0x70 = 112)
 *        CB    VOQ  ACCESS 0x2da0 / DATA1 0x2da4   - stock residual 0x0FFFFFFF
 *                            DATA0 0x2da8         - stock residual 0xFFFFFFFF
 *      Here we DO diverge: we write the permissive 0x7fff7fff into all 8 entries of
 *      both tables.  On the DQSCH table that is 32767 vs stock's 112 = ~292x DEEPER,
 *      the prime bufferbloat suspect on the upstream path (the central buffer is the
 *      reservoir that fills when the GPON upstream grant is the bottleneck).  On the
 *      CB table it is the other way round: stock's {0x0FFFFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFF} is far
 *      MORE permissive than our 0x7fff7fff, so "match stock" there means going
 *      DEEPER, not shallower.
 *      ⚠ The stock values are the DATA-register RESIDUAL after stock's last indexed
 *      write (ACCESS read back as 0x40000007 = last index 7), i.e. proven for entry
 *      7 and assumed uniform across the 8 entries - the same assumption our own
 *      uniform write makes.
 *
 * ★ SCOPE - WHICH traffic this actually governs (know it before reading a result):
 * only frames that take the DEEP-QUEUE path go through these thresholds.
 *   - HW-offloaded UPSTREAM (LAN->WAN) flows: YES, but CONDITIONALLY - the L3FE US
 *     egress action sets deepq only when the live data T-CONT <= 7
 *     (CN_L3E_PON_DEEPQ_TCONT_MAX in cortina-ni-flowoffload.c).  Read the live
 *     T-CONT off the box first: /proc/cortina_l3fe prints `live_pon{gem= tcont=}`.
 *     With a T-CONT above 7 the upstream offloaded path does NOT use the deep
 *     queue and this knob cannot move an upstream number at all.
 *   - CPU-forwarded UPSTREAM frames (the pon_data_enq path in cortina-ni-tx.c):
 *     NO - that path never sets deep_q in its HEADER_A.
 *   - HW-offloaded DOWNSTREAM flows: only with hw_ds_deepq=1, which is default OFF.
 *   - CPU-RX (frames trapped to the CPU): YES - this is the path the deep queue was
 *     brought up for in the first place.
 *
 * DEFAULT = the CURRENT permissive behaviour, byte-identical to what shipped: this
 * knob exists to MEASURE the trade (depth vs latency vs throughput), and picking a
 * different default is the operator's call, from numbers, never a silent change.
 *
 * RUNTIME-settable (not boot-time only): the tables are plain indexed RAM behind the
 * ACCESS/DATA protocol, so a write re-walks all 8 entries of both tables in place.
 *   echo 0x00700070 > /sys/module/cortina_ni/parameters/deepq_voq_thrsh
 *   echo 1          > /sys/module/cortina_ni/parameters/deepq_cb_stock
 * A bootarg works too and is the cleaner A/B (no in-flight transition):
 *   cortina_ni.deepq_voq_thrsh=0x00700070 cortina_ni.deepq_cb_stock=1
 * Read the ACTIVE value back off the running device with
 *   grep deepq-thrsh /proc/net/cortina_ni_rx
 * which prints BOTH the parameters AND a live indirect read of the HW table, so a
 * benchmark's configuration is provable after the fact.

	 * netdev rx read): stock delivered them (nas0_0 rx +77), ours delivered ZERO.
	 * Downstream UNICAST was unaffected throughout -- it resolves via the static
	 * FDB entry for our WAN MAC -- which is why the fault hid: the ONU keeps its
	 * lease, its default route and full outbound connectivity while no far end
	 * can ever ARP it, so nothing can initiate traffic towards the ONU and a
	 * DHCP server that has aged its own ARP entry out cannot deliver a lease at
	 * all.  Only a reboot cleared it, because a booting ONU transmits and thereby

	 *
	 * Kept as a SEPARATE loop rather than widening the bound above: the LAN ports

	 * this driver already paid for once.  A failure here is logged and does not

	 * eth0 carrier / no RJ45 ingress" and "wired LAN dies mid-session,
	 * carrier=1 but l3fe_rx and l3qm_rx both 0, only a cold boot clears
	 * it".  Intermittent because it is a race against boot timing;
	 * permanent-for-the-boot because nothing ever resets the counter.
	 *
	 * => the recovery now SLOWS DOWN and never stops.  Deleting the cap
	 * outright would install the other half of the defect - an unbounded
