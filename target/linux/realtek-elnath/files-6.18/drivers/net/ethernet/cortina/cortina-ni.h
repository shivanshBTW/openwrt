 * ★★ THE NI_HV COUNTER BLOCK IS READ-AND-CLEAR: IT HAS EXACTLY ONE READER.
 *
 * Stock's own ca-ne.ko labels this block "NI counter ===== (read-and-clear)",
 * and it is measured: reading 0xa9fc twice inside one /proc show returned the
 * count and then a structural 0, which was quoted as evidence in this tree for
 * weeks.  A read-and-clear register cannot have two consumers - whoever reads
 * it first TAKES the count and everyone after sees zero, which is a phantom
 * that reads as a healthy "nothing arrived".
 *
 * So the register is read in exactly ONE place - cortina_ni_nihv_sample() -
 * which folds each sample into a 64-bit driver-side total and hands the TOTAL
 * to every consumer.  /proc/net/cortina_ni_rx, /proc/cortina_l3fe and
 * `ethtool -S` all call it; none of them may readl() these offsets again.  The
 * totals are cumulative and monotonic, which is what a statistics interface
 * has to publish and what the raw register never was.
 *
 * ⚠ A caller that wants a DELTA keeps its own snapshot of the TOTAL and
 * subtracts.  Differencing the raw register was wrong twice over: the raw read
 * is already a delta, so `raw - prev_raw` is a delta of deltas.
 *
 * ⚠ The read-and-clear behaviour of this block is itself configurable (NI
 * 0x2010 bit31 is the control, and its setting differs between the stock image
 * and ours), so the accumulation is the FAIL-CLOSED choice: if the block were
 * ever left cumulative instead, the totals would over-count rather than lose
 * counts, and the over-count is visible (the total races ahead of the raw
 * register) where a lost count is not.  Anything that changes 0x2010 must
 * revisit this.
